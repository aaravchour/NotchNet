Reynard was a fox who was taken in by Farnum within Minecraft Legends: Return of the Piglins.


== Appearance ==
Though not described in detail, a clear picture could be made of Reynard. When it first met Farnum, it appeared to be critically injured, presumably from a predator or hunter attacking it, and could hardly even walk. The book proceeds to describe it running around and swiping objects for its own amusement, much like a normal Minecraft fox, but due to its condition and Farnum’s inexperience it’s likely that it had some form of permanent scarring or bandages. Furthermore, the book only describes its natural habitat as a taiga, so it’s most certainly a red fox.


== Biography ==
While hiking through a forest near his hometown, Farnum stumbled across an injured fox, far from its home and shivering in pain. Due to its condition, Farnum was able to carry Reynard to safety without difficulty. By the time Reynard recovered, he refused to be sent back to the wilderness. Instead, it would run around his house, craving berries. This inspired him to build an enclosure to support the fox, which eventually developed into an entire zoo after his neighbors flocked to see a fox up close.
In spite of the initial donations and goodwill, Farnum struggled to keep up the momentum. After Reynard, he had only managed to find a cow, a donkey, a pair of sheep, a rabbit, and a turtle, all of which were common sights in the area.


== Trivia ==
His name was possibly a reference to the legendary figure of Reynard the Fox, a literary cycle from Dutch, English, German, and French folktales. The mythical Reynard is a trickster character, who exploits fellow animals on repeat, most notably his uncle, a wolf named Isengrim (also known as Ysengrim).
Despite ultimately being a very minor character, the pure chance of Farnum stumbling upon Reynard indirectly led to the plot of the entire book. In that sense, it’s technically responsible for the deaths of Bungus and Uggub.
