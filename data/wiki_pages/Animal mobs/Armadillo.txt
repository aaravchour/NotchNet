Armadillo is a passive mob that spawns in warm biomes. Spider eyes, brushes, and lead can be used on the armadillo to breed, brush, or lead it respectively.


== Behaviour ==
Armadillos spawn in dry, slightly arid and warm biomes like the Savanna and the Badlands.
When a player is sprinting, mounting, or causes harm to an armadillo, or when an undead hostile mob is nearby, it rolls up into a cube-like shape to protect itself from harm. At some point in time, the armadillo peeks out its head from the shell, making sure it's safe to unroll. If it's not safe, its head disappears back into the shell. If it is safe, the armadillo unrolls itself.
Leashed armadillos do not roll up when harmed or scared.
Apart from all hostile mobs, spiders and cave spiders flee from armadillos.


== Breeding ==
Armadillos can be bred with spider eyes, creating a baby armadillo. Feeding spider eyes to a baby armadillo will accelerate its growth by 10%.


== Drops ==
When an adult armadillo is killed by a player or tamed wolf, it drops 3 experience points. However, baby armadillos don't drop anything. 1–7 experience points are rewarded upon successfully breeding two armadillos.
When a brush is used on an armadillo, it drops an armadillo scute, which can be used to craft wolf armor. Doing so wastes 13 points of the brush's durability. There is no cooldown for brushing an armadillo, and no limit as to how many scutes they can drop, given the player has enough brushes. This is unnecessary, however, as armadillos drop 1 scute every few minutes without the need for player interaction.

== Trivia ==
In real life, armadillos are excellent swimmers, being able to hold their breath for up to 6 minutes. This is not the case in Minecraft, however, as it drowns just as easily as any other mob.
Similarly to turtles, armadillos don't drop scutes when killed, even though it wouldn't make sense in real life.
This is because Mojang Studios is against the unnecessary killing of real-life animals in Minecraft.
While you may expect it, armadillos actually cannot roll when curled up.
Armadillos have spiky shells in real life.
