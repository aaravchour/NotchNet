A bat is a flying ambient passive mob that spawns in dark areas underground in caves.


== Spawning ==
Bats can spawn in groups of 8‌/2‌ in the Overworld at a light level of 3 or less on opaque blocks below layer 63. They also need at least 2 air blocks (or alternatively, a top trapdoor or top slab in the block above foot level). In Java Edition, between October 20 and November 3, they require a light level of 6 or less to spawn. On Superflat worlds, bats spawn below the top non-air layer, ignoring the usual layer-63 limitation.


== Drops ==
Bats do not drop any items or experience upon death.


== Behavior ==
Bats are small, less than a block tall and wide. They squeak randomly. They often fly around aimlessly, tending to favor the east, and sometimes accidentally fly into lava and catch on fire.
Bats hang upside down on the underside of a solid block when idle, though they cannot hang on transparent or non-solid blocks. If a player approaches a bat hanging upside down, even if the player is invisible, it flies away. This also happens if the player breaks the block the bat is hanging from.
Bats despawn when too far away from the player (over 32 blocks away).
Bats' collision boxes do not interact with the player or redstone components.


== Sounds ==
Java Edition:
Bats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

== Trivia ==
According to Jeb, the bat is an example of an ambient mob – a mob that constantly spawns, similar to the squid, but also constantly despawns because when a player is not around it does not serve any purpose.
Between 20 October and 3 November, bats spawn more frequently as a small easter egg in homage to Halloween.‌
