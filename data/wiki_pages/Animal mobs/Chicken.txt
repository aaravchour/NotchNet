The chicken is a passive mob found in grass biomes and the main source of raw chicken, feathers, and eggs. A chicken, like most animals, can be attached to a lead.


== Spawning ==
Chickens spawn naturally in the Overworld in groups of four above grass blocks with two blocks of free space above it at a light level of nine or more. Chickens do not spawn in deserts, snowy plains, ice spikes, snowy slopes, meadows, wooded badlands, jagged peaks, frozen peaks and stony peaks. In Java Edition, chickens are more common in sparse jungles. Chickens spawn individually after the world generation and 5% of chickens spawn as baby chickens. In Bedrock Edition, chickens require a light level of 7 or more to spawn and spawn in groups of two to four during the world generation.


=== Chicken jockey ===

All baby zombie variants and baby zombified piglins have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey. Because a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.25% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%. A chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command: 
/summon minecraft:chicken ~ ~ ~ {IsChickenJockey:1b,Passengers:[{id:"minecraft:zombie",IsBaby:1b}]} 
Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped. Baby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a golden sword. Harming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack. Chickens spawn in the Nether in this way.
In Bedrock Edition, baby zombie jockeys do not spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking the player, a wandering trader, an adult villager, a snow golem or an iron golem.


== Drops ==

Adult chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay an egg every five to ten minutes. 
When an adult chicken is killed, it drops from zero to two feathers. The maximum is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five with Looting III. The chicken also drops one raw chicken or one cooked chicken (if it is killed while on fire). The maximum is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of one to four with Looting III. From one to three experience orbs are dropped when the chicken is killed by the player or a tamed wolf or ten experience orbs if it was part of a chicken jockey. When two adult chickens breed, from one to seven experience orbs are dropped. Killing a baby chicken yields no items or experience.


== Behavior ==
A chicken wanders aimlessly but goes after players holding various seeds within a six by four by six cubic area, while a baby chicken follows adult chickens. Chickens uniquely attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally. 
Chickens avoid falling off cliffs and flap their wings when they are in mid air and fall slowly, thus they are immune to fall damage. When harmed, chickens flee around for about two seconds. Ocelots and foxes pursue and attack chickens. 
While in a loaded chunk, an adult chicken lays an egg every five to ten minutes (from 6000 to 12000 in-game ticks) unless it is, or was, a part of a chicken jockey. If the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, an indicative sound is heard.
Chickens stay underwater for 15 seconds or can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water surface. While swimming, a chicken needs only one block of air above its head.
A chicken is 11 pixels or 0.6875 blocks tall. A baby chicken is 5.5 pixels tall or 0.34375 blocks tall.


== Breeding ==

If two adult chickens are fed wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, torchflower seeds or a pitcher pod, a baby chicken spawns. The adult chickens cannot breed for five minutes afterward.

Baby chickens take 20 minutes to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed seeds. A baby chicken fed a seed once per second will grow up in approximately 48 seconds using 47 seeds. A baby chicken fed a seed once per ticks will grow up in approximately three seconds using 56 seeds. Baby chickens are smaller than a half-block and can unwillingly pass through openings smaller than a full block, but do not walk through half-block-tall spaces. A baby chicken riding a minecart cannot be hit because it is completely inside the minecart's hitbox.


=== Eggs ===

Chickens are an Overworld mob that can repopulate without breeding. Adult chickens lay eggs at random and an egg thrown at the ground by a player or a dispenser has a 1⁄8 chance of spawning a baby chicken. If a baby chicken spawns from a thrown egg, there is a further 1⁄32 chance to spawn three extra baby chickens or 1⁄256 overall. It is theoretically possible (though extremely unlikely, at less than 1⁄3.4e38) for a stack of 16 eggs to yield 64 chickens if all spawn chances succeed for all eggs.
If the player throws an egg at a glass pane, the baby chicken can spawn on the far side of the pane.
As chickens can produce each other with eggs, they're perhaps the only passive mob you can farm with just a single individual, if you're willing to wait patiently and constantly throw eggs.

Chickens use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

== Trivia ==
When a chicken is killed off a ledge, the corpse also falls more slowly than normal and the wings continue flapping.
Chickens are able to "hide" within hoppers due to their small size, which protects them from dangers like lava on top of the hopper.
A few weeks before the end of Java Edition Beta, Notch tweeted that he changed the chickens to ducks, causing a turmoil on Twitter. A few days later, Jeb, still getting feedback on the idea, stated that it was just a joke.
The changelog for Pocket Edition v0.3.0 alpha referred to chickens as ducks.
Notch later referred to chickens in a blog post as "the chicken/duck/whatevers".
In A Minecraft Movie, Chickens are hostile against each other when provoked, or attack the humans when a Baby Zombie rides it. However, they do share the same features and appearance as their in-game counterparts.
