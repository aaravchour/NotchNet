An ocelot is a passive mob that may be found in jungles.


== Spawning ==
Ocelots spawn above grass blocks in jungle biomes. The spawning occurs at the world's sea level (Y-level 63 per default) or at higher levels. Ocelots spawn as one or two adult ocelots in 95% of times or as ocelot kittens in 5% of times. There is a small chance for two ocelot kittens to spawn when an adult ocelot spawns naturally. Ocelots are found in all kinds of jungle biomes in Bedrock Edition. Ocelots spawn as hostile mobs in Java Edition; as a counterbalance, there is a 1⁄3 chance for a spawn attempt to fail in jungles and spawning does not occur in bamboo jungles or sparse jungles. Because of this, while ocelots are passive animal mobs, they cannot spawn at all on Peaceful difficulty.


== Drops ==
Adult ocelots drop 1–3 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf. Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped. Killing an ocelot kitten yields no experience.


== Behavior ==
Ocelots are immune to fall damage, but still avoid falls. An ocelot attacks chickens and baby turtles. They sneak and stalk their prey before chasing it down. They can kill through a fence, a fence gate or a door if they are against it.
Creepers stay six blocks away from an ocelot. A creeper within this range that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. Phantoms stay 16 blocks away from an ocelot in Bedrock Edition.
With the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults.

Ocelots are one of the few mobs that can sprint and sprint away from nearby players in Survival or Adventure mode.
Ocelots approach players holding raw cod or raw salmon within 10 blocks. If the player moves, turns their head too quickly or stops holding the item while within 6 blocks, the ocelot flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.
A player gains an ocelot's trust by feeding it raw cod or salmon until heart particles show, causing it to no longer flee from players. Each food item has a 1⁄3 chance of gaining the ocelot's trust.
Ocelots that are trusting do not despawn (a bug in Java version leads to despawningMC-196031 see comments); otherwise, they may despawn when far enough from a player, similar to hostile mobs.


== Breeding ==

When a trusting ocelot is fed raw cod or raw salmon, it enters love mode. Breeding creates an ocelot kitten that trusts the player in Bedrock Edition. The adults cannot breed again for 5 minutes once they have completed breeding. The growth of baby ocelots can be accelerated slowly using these raw fish. Each cod or salmon takes 10% off the remaining time to mature.


== Sounds ==
Java Edition:
Ocelots use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.
