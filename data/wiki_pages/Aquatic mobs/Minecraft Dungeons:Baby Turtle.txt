== Trivia ==
A tweet on the dungeons Twitter attempts to connect the relationship between turtle armor and the baby turtle.
The baby turtle appears in a tweet from Minecraft Dungeons, encouraging heroes to bring the pet to the hidden depths missions.
The baby turtle can seemingly float in the air instead of swim when in a land-based mission. This is probably some unfixed or intentional feature with the pet.
Despite this, the baby turtle is seen crawling in a Twitter video, hiding in its shell on the ground to avoid being trampled by a zombie horde.
