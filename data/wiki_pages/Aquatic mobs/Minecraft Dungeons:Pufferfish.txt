A Pufferfish is a passive aquatic animal  that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
Pufferfish are a yellow fish with spikes and bluish-white fins, similar to its real-life counterpart, the Long-spined porcupinefish (Diodon Holocanthus).


== Spawning ==
Coral Rise
Abyssal Monument
Radiant Ravine


== Behavior ==
A pufferfish inflates when a hero or mob get too close. At close range, the pufferfish can deal damage and inflict Poison. It then reverts into a small form when no mob is near. When a pufferfish is killed, it emits a poison cloud that inflicts up to 6 damage.
