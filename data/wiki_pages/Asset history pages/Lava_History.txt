=== Lava "items" ===
The following content is transcluded from Technical blocks/Lava.


==== Appearances ====


==== Names ====


===== Still Lava =====
Java Edition
Item names did not exist prior to Beta 1.0.

Beta 1.0 - 14w21b: Lava
(As block name, item does not exist) 14w25a and onwards: Lava
The flowing and stationary lava blocks has been removed and lava block has become generic. Generic lava block's resource location is minecraft:lava.
Bedrock Edition
? - ?: tile.lava.name


===== Flowing Lava =====

Every frame, for each position in the still water texture array, the respective values for soup_heat, pot_heat and flame_heat are calculated as detailed below:

Calculates a local_soup_heat equal to the sum of the 3x3 soup_heat neighborhood around the current element but offset vertically by colSin******* and offset horizontally by rowSin*********.
rowSin is 1.2 times the sign of an angle that starts at 0 and changes by 22.5 degrees every row.
colSin is 1.2 times the sign of an angle that starts at 0 and changes by 22.5 degrees every column.
Calculates a local_pot_heat equal to the sum of a 2x2 pot_heat neighborhood around the current pot_heat, with the current position being the upper left of the 2x2 neighborhood.
Calculates the new soup_heat as the sum of the local_soup_heat divided by 10 plus the local_pot_heat divided by 4 times 0.8.
Calculates the new pot_heat as the current pot_heat plus the flame_heat times 0.01***************. pot_heat is clamped to a minimum of 0.
Calculates the new flame_heat as the current flame_heat minus 0.06.
However, there is a 0.005 in 1 random chance that flame_heat is set to 1.5.
Once the above arrays have been updated, for each pixel in the lava texture, the color values are calculated based on soup_heat (alpha is always opaque for lava):

Calculates a color_heat as double the soup_heat clamped between 0 and 1 inclusive.
Then it calculates the color components of the pixel as follows:
float red = color_heat * 100F + 155F
float green = color_heat^2 * 255F
float blue = color_heat^4 * 128F
The red, green and blue values are then converted to bytes and assigned to the texture accordingly.


==== Flowing lava ====
Flowing lava uses the exact same texture as still lava, however there is also a spatial translation to give the appearance of movement. This transformation moves the lava texture downwards by one pixel after a fixed amount of time, wrapping the bottom layer of the texture back to the top.
