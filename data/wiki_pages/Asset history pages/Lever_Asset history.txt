===== Block texture and model history =====

Wall levers

Floor levers

Ceiling levers

Notes
The lever model was changed in 19w03c to add cullface to the cobblestone cuboid, as well as to delete an unneeded face from the handle that cannot be seen normally. Neither of these change the outwards appearance of the lever,
The following reported issues may change the appearance of levers in future if fixed:
MC-262631 - Lever texture mapping is wrong on sides of cobblestone base
MC-262864 - Lever base texture is mapped upside-down
MC-262865 - Lever handle is shaded


===== Lighting changes =====
Several files have been uploaded to the wiki stating changes to lighting. What exactly most of these changes are have yet to be described in detail, and they do not appear to be related to texture or model changes (ambient occlusion and directional shading are counted under model changes).
