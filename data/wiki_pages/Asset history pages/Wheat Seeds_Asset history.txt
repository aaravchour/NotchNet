Intentional data values

Extreme data values

While blocks have four bits assigned for metadata, only the bottom three are used by crops. As the eight textures for crops were all arranged in a straight line in terrain.png, crops with metadata values 8-15 would overflow and start reading textures from the next line. As the textures in these positions were changed multiple times, this also resulted in wheat with extreme metadata changing visually, often displaying the placeholder texture as a result.
