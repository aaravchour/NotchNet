The basalt deltas is a volcanic biome found in the Nether.


== Description ==
The basalt deltas is composed largely of basalt and blackstone. Its fog appears in a dull lilac color with ash particles passing by. Archipelagos with islands of different sizes can be found around the lava seas nearby.
Nether fortresses and caves filled with nether quartz ore can also be found here. Ore generates more commonly (to compensate for less netherrack to generate in). Bastion remnants do not generate here.
Basalt deltas are exceedingly dangerous due to their jagged terrain, countless deltas, ghasts and magma cubes. Magma cubes jump from above and are immune to damage from lava. Due to their high spawn rate, they can pose a threat to the player even while wearing netherite armor, but they also make the biome the best place from which to obtain magma cream. Being bumped here is more dangerous than in other biomes, as cliffs and hidden lava pools are common.

== Trivia ==
Basalt Deltas biomes never share their border with Crimson Forest biomes.
Basalt Deltas are notable for having the constant, faint sound of a Geiger counter clicking. This is possibly due to the fact that radon gas, which is spewed from volcanoes during eruption, is a highly radioactive element. Given the basalt deltas' volcanic nature with ash particles floating around, one can assume the clicks are meant to imply the biome is a radioactive wasteland.
