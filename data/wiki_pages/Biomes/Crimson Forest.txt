The crimson forest is a forested biome in the Nether.


== Description ==
The crimson forest is dense and has a crimson color scheme. The forest's fog is dark red and blazing particles are seen floating. The forest floor is mostly covered with crimson nylium, with some netherrack and nether wart blocks generating on the surface as well. The vegetation of the biome includes fungi, crimson roots, huge crimson fungi and weeping vines. These vines hang from the large fungi and nether wart blocks from the ceiling.

== Trivia ==
When the crimson forest was announced at MINECON Live 2019, which happened before the first Nether Update snapshot was released, it was known as "Nether wart forest". In the announcement, however, it was called "Nether wart forest red".
Most of the ambience in the crimson forest was made using balloons, which Samuel Åberg says creates a disturbing feeling of something stretching and forcing itself to bend.
This biome might be a reference to the game Terraria, in which there is also a red biome called the Crimson. There is also a similar occurrence with the blue Hallow biome and the Warped Forest.
The crimson forest's music track, Chrysopoeia, is named after a term in alchemy that refers to the transmutation of base metals into gold. This name ties with the Nether's relation to gold and the brewing mechanic.
Basalt Deltas biomes never share their border with Crimson Forest biomes.
