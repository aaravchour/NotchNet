Ice deserts were unused snow-covered biomes which existed prior to the Adventure Update, these biomes were large sand flats with a snow layer cover. 


== Description ==
Ice deserts are similar in appearance to tundras, with fairly flat land and small hills. However, instead of grass the surface is primarily made up of sand. Flowers, trees and passive mobs are non-existent in this biome. Ice deserts usually generate surrounded by the tundra as well. The ice desert only existed as an unused biome; it was in the code but never implemented into the temperature/rainfall table and thus did not actually generate without the use of mods. It is the coldest biome to spawn as it generates if the temperature is below 10%.
