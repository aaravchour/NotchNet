The low temperature taiga biome comprises a humid grassland forested with small and large ferns, sweet  berry bushes and pine and spruce trees, the main source of spruce logs and leaves.


== Description ==
The cold surface of a taiga biome is a grassland with a large number of ferns, large ferns and pine and spruce trees, forming a dense coniferous forest. Only pine and spruce trees are natural to taigas, compared to oak and birch trees in forests. Due to the structure of spruce trees, more tall than wide, the foliage is less dense, but still dense enough to possibly get players lost. The vegetation also includes short grass, dandelions, poppies and sweet berry bushes, and takes a dull aquamarine-green hue. The water coloration has a unique dark-turquoise tone in in Bedrock Edition.

Taigas are often separated from meadows by rivers or are most commonly bordered by old growth taigas, snowy taigas, groves, forests or swamps, and the frequent rainfall and water sources changes to snowfall and ice, respectively, above the layer 160 within taigas due to the cold climate. 
Outposts, villages and trail ruins generate in taigas occasionally. These villages are made of spruce wood appropriately and often contain pumpkin farms and gardens filled with the poppy flowers. Villages can also serve as a handy refuge and as a trading site should one be found.
Sheep, cold pigs, cold cows, cold chickens, pale wolves, red foxes and rabbits spawn in taigas, though rabbits are not often seen due to wolves chasing after them and killing them. 
Taigas are one of the most preferred biomes to start out in Survival mode. The abundance of logs, grassy terrain and useful passive mobs make this biome easy for players. Taigas share the same dangers of forests, however; the players can get lost within the trees easily if they don't mark their trails and the foliage can lead to obstructed vision, especially at night. The following mobs are naturally spawned here：
