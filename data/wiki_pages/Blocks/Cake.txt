Cake is a food and a block that can be eaten by the player.
A cake with candle is a light-producing variation created when a candle is used on an uneaten cake.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Once the cake is placed, it cannot be recollected even with the use of Silk Touch. Candle cakes always drop their respective candle when broken.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Crafting ===


=== Trading ===
Expert-level farmer villagers can sell cake for a single emerald each. The chance is 2⁄7 in Java Edition.


== Usage ==

Unlike most food, the cake cannot be eaten as an item in the hotbar. Before being eaten, it must first be placed on top of a solid block. Placing the cake on a slab also works, as the slab acts like a solid block. The cake instead floats half a block on top of the slab.
Each cake has seven "slices"; each use consumes one slice progressing inward from the west. A single slice restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation. Eating all seven slices of a cake restores 14 ( × 7) hunger and 2.8 hunger saturation.
Since eating a cake comes with no animation, the cake can be eaten at a rate of one slice per tick. Multiple players can eat from the same cake at the same time. In Java Edition, eating cake makes no sound, unlike other foods.
As a redstone component, when connected to a comparator, a whole cake emits a signal strength of 14. The signal strength decreases two units with each slice.
Cake destroys falling blocks if placed under them, similar to a torch.


=== Pandas ===
Some pandas move toward a dropped cake to pick up and eat it. Some may not, depending on the cake's location. 


=== Composting ===
Placing a cake into a composter raises the compost level by 1.


=== Piston interactivity ===
A cake is broken when pushed by a piston, and it drops nothing.


=== Cakes with candles ===

Using a candle on an uneaten cake creates a candle cake of that color (including uncolored). Eating the cake causes the candle to drop. 
Using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile on an unlit candle cake lights its candle. Lit candle cakes emit light level of 3. Clicking on the lit candle (but not the cake) extinguishes it.

== Trivia ==


=== Interaction ===
Because cake is only 7⁄8 blocks wide, it is possible to stand on the edge of a block beneath a cake.
It is possible to place cake on top of another cake by placing a cake on the ground, then placing another cake on the side of a block above and to the side of the first cake, similar to placing torches on a chest. Eating the lower cake causes the upper cake to disappear, as does mining out the block of cake it is sitting on.
It is also possible to place any block on top of cakes (including another cake) by sneaking and placing the block on top of a cake.
Mobs on top of cakes rotate while attempting to move, a pathfinding oversight shared with fences.
If cake is placed in a hole one block deep, players can get across the hole without jumping, although a player standing on the cake must jump to get out of the hole.
Cake can be used to create a functioning staircase, by placing a cake on each level of a 1 block by 1 block incline. This would be one of the most labor-intensive staircases available, given the requirements to craft a cake, compared to any other method of creating a staircase. This staircase is also extremely overpowered when combined with a horse being one of the fastest forms of travel.
At some point, it was possible to push cakes into the void using pistons.


=== Miscellaneous ===

Cake was added to Minecraft following the ModDB 2010 Indie of the Year Awards. Notch agreed to add cake to Minecraft if it won, which led to a campaign called "The Quest For Cake". Minecraft won 3 of the 7 awards, including the "Indie of the Year" award.
Placing a cake makes the same sound as placing wool.
The player can place cake on top of a bed, and while sleeping, the cake shows on the player's screen as if it were on top of their head.
The name of the achievement for crafting a cake is a reference to the internet meme "The Cake is a Lie", which originated from Valve Software's game, Portal.
On May 17, 2019, for the 10th anniversary of Minecraft, the cake model was changed to display a "10" above it, made of white concrete.
Unlike most foods, cakes don't count towards the advancement "A Balanced Diet" in Java Edition.
