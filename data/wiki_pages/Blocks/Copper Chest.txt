A copper chest is a copper variant of a normal chest that was added in The Copper Age. It can store various items similar to chests and can be interacted by copper golems. It also undergoes oxidation process, just like normal copper blocks.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Copper chests drops itself and its contents when mined using stone or a better pickaxe. Otherwise, it only drop contents and the copper chest will disappear.


=== Crafting ===


=== Spawning ===
Placing a carved pumpkin or a jack o'Lantern on top of a copper block generates a copper chest with a copper golem spawned on top of it. This also applies to all waxed and oxidized variants.
Copper chests do not generate if a copper golem is spawned using a Spawn Egg or by a /summon command.


== Oxidation ==
Like most copper blocks, unwaxed copper chests undergo 4 stages of oxidation:

Unoxidized - Normal stage
Exposed
Weathered
Oxidized
Only lightning and axes can reverse the oxidation process. Using a honeycomb on an unwaxed copper chest prevents oxidation.

== Trivia ==
The top texture of a single Copper Chest is similar to the texture of a Copper Trapdoor.
Waxed Weathered Copper Double Chest is now the longest block name in the game, compared to Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks.
Due to a weird bug, normal copper chests sometimes connect to their waxed variants, although they are different and look similar.
