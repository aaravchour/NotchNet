=== Breaking ===
Crafters can be broken by hand, but a pickaxe is the fastest tool.


== Usage ==


=== Crafting ===
Crafters are used to craft items when activated by a redstone signal. They have 9 container slots arranged in a 3x3 grid (like that of a crafting table). The crafting ingredients are arranged in this grid in the exact same way as you would to craft the desired item on a crafting table. A crafter does not craft upon activation if the ingredients in the grid are arranged in an invalid recipe.
The slots in the crafter can be disabled so only certain slots can be filled. This allows for hoppers to load ingredients in when crafting items with a specific shape, such as rails.
When receiving a redstone signal, one ingredient from each slot is consumed, and the crafted result is dropped as an item out from the side of the crafter, similar to how a dropper drops items.
Crafters only craft the items once when a redstone signal activates it, similar to droppers and dispensers. It does not craft continuously under a redstone signal.


=== Hopper interactivity ===
Crafters can receive ingredients from a hopper pointing into it, filling the slots in turn. 
Hoppers placed underneath the crafter can remove ingredients from it.


=== Redstone interactivity ===
Crafters can be read by redstone comparators and output power levels based on the number of slots occupied. 


=== Piston interactivity ===
Crafters cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons.


=== Redstone activation ===
Crafters do not seem to be activated by quasi-connectivity.
