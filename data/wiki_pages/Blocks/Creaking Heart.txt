A Creaking heart is a "living" block that rarely generates in natural pale oak trees of the pale garden. This block summons and puppeteers the creaking, when it is active in the night.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
The Creaking heart can be broken using any tool, however the axe is the quickest. It can be obtained using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, otherwise it drops 1-3 resin clumps; Fortune can increase the maximum drops by 1 per level (up to 6 with Fortune 3).
Destroying a naturally-generated creaking heart drops 20-24 experience, only in Survival mode.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
The creaking heart can be activated by placing a creaking heart between 2 pale oak logs, which will spawn creaking at night as long as there is a valid spawn area in a 32 block radius of the creaking heart. The creaking heart also generates resin clumps on nearby pale oak logs upon a player hitting the creaking spawned by the creaking heart.


== Appearance ==
