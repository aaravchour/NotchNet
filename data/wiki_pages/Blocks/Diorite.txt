== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===

Diorite can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. 
In Bedrock Edition, Diorite attempts to generate in two batches in all biomes in the Overworld. The first batch generate 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60. The second batch has 1⁄6 chance to generate blobs of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. In Bedrock Edition, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, polished andesite‌, polished diorite‌, and polished granite‌. In Java Edition, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, tuff, and deepslate.
Diorite generates in weaponsmith houses, tannery houses, and mason houses in snowy tundra villages.
In Bedrock Edition, diorite generates in coral reefs, replacing some blocks of coral crust.
Polished diorite also generates in warm underwater ruins.


=== Breaking ===
Diorite can be mined using any pickaxe. If broken without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

=== Stonecutting ===


=== Trading ===
Journeyman-level stone mason villagers have a 2⁄7 chance to sell 4 polished diorite for an emerald.

== Trivia ==
In the real world, diorite comes from underground magma chambers that turned cold. Diorite usually has a salt & pepper appearance.
Andesite is diorite's above-ground equivalent: The two rocks come from the same kind of magma, but andesite forms in lava flows. Its fast cooling is what makes it look smoother than diorite.
Granite is another magma chamber rock, but it's made of more quartz crystals. That is why in Minecraft, granite can be crafted by combining diorite and nether quartz.
In the real world, diorite is an extremely hard rock and is difficult to carve and work with.
In Minecraft: Story Mode, Reuben's grave on Episode 4 is made out of diorite and a new stair variant of it which cannot be found in Minecraft until the Village & Pillage update, which was announced roughly 3 years after Episode 4. It is unknown whether diorite slabs are present.
