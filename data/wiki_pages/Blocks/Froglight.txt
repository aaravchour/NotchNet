A froglight is a light-emitting block that is obtained when a frog eats a tiny magma cube. It comes in three variants based on the variant of frog that eats the magma cube.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Froglights drop as an item when broken with any tool or by hand. No tool will cause the froglight to break faster.


=== Mob loot ===

A tiny magma cube drops a froglight when it is eaten by a frog. There are three colors of froglight that drop depending on what type of frog kills the magma cube:


== Usage ==
Froglights have a smooth texture and are used as light sources. They emit light level 15, the highest level possible for a light-emitting block. Froglights also melt snow layers within 3 blocks and ice within 4 blocks (taxicab distance).
Froglights can be placed in three different orientations, similar to logs and basalt.

== Trivia ==
According to a Block of the Month article, froglights are organic substances since they’re live organisms that have been digested and then spat out by a frog, revealing that frogs don’t actually fully eat magma cubes, and only try to do so before spitting it out.
One name for the pearlescent froglight during development was the "blanc froglight".
The block was named after popular Minecraft YouTuber, Pearlescentmoon.
