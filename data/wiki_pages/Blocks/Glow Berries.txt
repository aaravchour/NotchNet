Glow berries are a food item obtained from cave vines and can be used to plant them.
Cave vines are a climbable, bonemealable plant that hangs off ceilings and grows glow berries. Cave vines with glow berries produce light. 


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Cave vines can be instantly broken with any tools or by hand. Cave vines with glow berries drop glow berries when broken or harvested. Cave vines with no glow berries will not drop anything. Fortune has no effect on the number of glow berries dropped.


=== Natural generation ===
Cave vines can be found in lush caves, hanging from cave ceilings.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Post-generation ===
Glow berries can be collected from a cave vine by using or breaking the vine. This yields one glow berry when the vine is bearing them and nothing when it is not.  A cave vine also breaks if water runs over its location or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location. 


== Usage ==


=== Placement ===
Glow berries can be placed on and grown from the bottom of most blocks. They have no specific lighting requirements. When placed, they can be of any length.


=== Growth ===
Placing glow berries on the bottom of a block creates a cave vine that grows downward one block at a time as long as air is beneath it, and its age is less than 25. When the glow berry is placed, the vine is given a random age between 0 and 25. As the vine grows, the bottom-most vine increases the vine's age by 1. Once age 25 is reached, the vine stops growing. Breaking the vine will change the vine's age to a random number between 0 and 25. Each newly-grown cave vine block has a 1 in 9 chance of bearing glow berries. Only this tip can ever naturally grow them.‌
Using bone meal on a cave vine produces glow berries if the vine was not bearing any.
In Java Edition, cave vines stop growing if shears are used on the tip (the age of the vine will be set to 25).
In Bedrock Edition, if placing glow berries in the Nether, cave vines are able to grow and produces glow berries.


=== Food ===
To eat glow berries, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation points, like sweet berries.


=== Light ===
When bearing glow berries, cave vines give off a light level of 14.


=== Composting ===
Placing glow berries into a composter by using them on it has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.


=== Breeding ===
Glow berries can be fed to foxes to breed them. Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the player may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds glow berries. The resulting baby fox trusts the player and does not flee.
Glow berries can be used on baby foxes to reduce the time until they grow by 10%.
