== Issues ==
Glowing obsidian is an unsupported block, and as such, issues relating to them may not be fixed.


== Trivia ==
Glowing obsidian makes an appearance in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two, spawning around the observer when Jesse places the structure block and on the bottom of the obsidian cages Vos was in.
Glowing obsidian has no name assigned to it, so its in-game name appears as tile.glowingobsidian.name, although it can be assigned a custom name using a resource pack with a language file.
Glowing obsidian is 2 levels brighter than crying obsidian. However, at the time when the glowing obsidian was available, the crying obsidian was not implemented until the release of the Nether Update.
