== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Muddy mangrove roots can be broken by hand, but using a shovel speeds up the process. Muddy mangrove roots drop themselves when broken with any tool.


=== Crafting ===


=== Natural generation ===
Muddy mangrove roots naturally generate in mangrove swamps where mud blocks intersect with normal mangrove roots at the bottom of mangrove trees.


=== Post generation ===
When a mangrove propagule grows into a tree, if the tree roots intersect with nearby mud blocks, those mud blocks are converted into muddy mangrove roots.
