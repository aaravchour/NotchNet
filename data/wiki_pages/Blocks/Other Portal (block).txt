An Other Portal is a joke block.


== Obtaining ==
The shape of the Other Portal is similar to a Nether Portal, except that it uses Glowstone instead.
It also uses a Water Bucket instead of a Flint and Steel to light the portal.
The Other Portal must be enabled by passing a vote for it, or by using the /vote command to approve it.


== Usage ==
The Other Portal was added as a reference to the Aether, a popular mod for Minecraft which added a fourth dimension to the game.
However, when entering the Other Portal, the player is teleported 500 blocks upwards, and the message "Error 404 Terrain Not Found!" is displayed.
If the portal is created above Y=200, it teleports players to Y=650 instead, so they aren't teleported to the Moon instead.

== Issues ==
Other portal blocks are an unsupported item due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed.
