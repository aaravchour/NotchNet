Solid blocks consist of any type of block that has a collision block that players, mobs, or other entities cannot move through.


== Properties ==
Players, mobs and other entities are able to walk on top of solid blocks. Particles that are affected by gravity (e.g. slime particles or water drip particles) also collide with solid blocks.
Mobs require a solid top surface to spawn. Some mobs are able to spawn inside of the space occupied by another block, but only if their hitbox does not intersect the collision of any solid block. See spawn conditions for more information.


== List of blocks ==


=== List of solid blocks ===
The following blocks are all solid blocks. They are categorized by their material.


=== List of non-solid blocks ===
The following is a list of blocks that are not solid. They are categorized by their material.


== Height ==

Most solid blocks are 1 meter high, but certain blocks have non-standard block heights.
A player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height, if the difference is at most 0.6 (3⁄5) of a block. From ground level, this is anything the height of a chain or less.
A player can fit through spaces as small as 1.8125 (29⁄16) blocks high, since players are 1.8 blocks tall. This allows players to fit through a 2-block gap with a floor as high as a trapdoor.
When sneaking, a player can fit through spaces as small as 1.75 (7⁄4) blocks high‌, or 1.5 blocks‌, since sneaking players are 1.65 blocks or 1.5 blocks tall, respectively. In Bedrock, this allows players to fit through a 2-block gap with a floor as high as 3 layers of snow. In Java, players can fit through a 2-block space with a floor as high as a slab.
When gliding with elytra, a player can fit through spaces as small as 0.625 (5⁄8) blocks high, since gliding players are 0.6 blocks tall. This allows players to fit through a 1-block gap with a floor as high as 4 layers of snow, a flower pot, or a daylight sensor.
Note that doors, although appearing to be one 2-meter-high block, are actually composed of two (top and bottom) 1-meter-high blocks.
Here is a list of blocks with non-standard heights, from tallest to shortest in height:


== Width ==

Many blocks are less than 1 meter wide on one or more sides.
The table below shows the widths of various blocks. If a block has several hit boxes of different sizes (for example: brewing stands), then each hitbox is listed separately. Blocks with sides of different widths are listed with cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) for each side, assuming that the block was placed from above, with the player facing north.
