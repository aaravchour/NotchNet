== Issues ==
Swaggiest Stairs Ever blocks are an unsupported item due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed.


== Trivia ==
Despite being an April Fools' joke block, it made an appearance in Minecraft Dungeons as part of the Nether Portal structure on Ancient Hunts.
It is often mistakenly called as "Netherite stairs" or "Block of Netherite Stairs" due to its similar appearance to the Block of Netherite
