Trial spawners are spawners within Trial Chambers. They spawn waves of mobs, including zombies, husks, slimes, spiders, cave spiders, silverfish, skeleton, strays, and breezes. After defeating all the waves of mobs, the trial spawner will dispense a random reward, and then deactivate for 30 real-world minutes.

Trial spawners can be changed into their Ominous variant by getting into spawning range with the Bad Omen status effect. This will spawn mobs even if the spawner is deactivated. The mobs that spawn are stronger, and better equipped. After defeating the wave of mobs, they drop better loot, along with the chance of an ominous trial key which is used to open the ominous vault.
