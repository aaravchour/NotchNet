The water spawner was a block that would repeatedly create water on each of its four orthogonal sides.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Water spawners can be broken instantly, regardless of held items.


=== Chest loot ===
Water spawners could be found in Indev House chests in stacks of 99 in in-20100124-2, and stacks of 100 in-20100128. Prior to this, they were added to the player's inventory by default in a stack of 5.


== Usage ==

The water spawner has many visual and functional differences from normal water:

It is a full, solid cube block with full block collision.
It is completely opaque.
All sides use the same still water texture.


=== Creating liquids ===
Immediately after placement, the water spawner creates source blocks of water on each of its four orthogonal sides. If these created sources are removed, they will be regenerated after enough time.


=== Sponges ===
Water spawners are deleted by sponges.
