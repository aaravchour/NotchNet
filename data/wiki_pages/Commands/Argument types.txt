This page contains a list of all command argument types.


== Java Edition ==


=== brigadier:bool ===
Must be a  boolean (either true or false).


=== brigadier:double ===
Must be a  Double-precision floating-point format number.
Each double argument may have a custom minimum and maximum value.
Precision varies throughout number line; the maximum absolute value is about 1.8*10308.


=== brigadier:float ===
Must be a  Single-precision floating-point format number.
Each float argument type may have a custom minimum and maximum value.
Precision varies throughout number line; the maximum absolute value is about 3.4*1038.


=== brigadier:integer ===
Must be a  32-bit integer number.
Each integer argument type may have a custom minimum and maximum value.
Maximum range is from −(231) to (231 − 1), or from (−2,147,483,648) to (2,147,483,647).


=== brigadier:long ===
Must be a  64-bit long.
Note: Although a long argument type is present in brigadier, it is not used by Minecraft.
Each long argument type may have a custom minimum and maximum value.
Maximum range is from −(263) to (263−1), or from (−9,223,372,036,854,775,808) to (9,223,372,036,854,775,807).


=== brigadier:string ===
Must be a string.
Each string argument type can accept either a single word (no spaces), a quotable phrase (either single word or quoted string), or a greedy phrase (taking the rest of the command as the string argument).


=== minecraft:angle ===
Must be a yaw angle, measured in degrees with float number. -180.0 for due north, -90.0 for due east, 0.0 for due south, 90.0 for due west, to 179.9 for just west of due north, before wrapping back around to -180.0. Tilde notation can be used to specify a rotation relative to the execution yaw angle.


=== minecraft:block_pos ===
Must be a block position composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be an integer or a tilde and caret notation.


=== minecraft:block_predicate ===
The format of block_predicate parameters is block_id[block_states]{data_tags}, in which block states and data tags can be omitted when they are not needed.

block_id is required, and it should be in the format of resource location(if namespace isn't set it defaults to minecraft:).
It can also be the resource location of a block tag prefixed with #, such as #minecraft:planks.
Block states are inside [], comma-separated and must be properties/values supported by the blocks. They are optional.
minecraft:stone[doesntexist=purpleberry] is unparseable, because stone doesn't have doesntexist.
minecraft:redstone_wire[power=tuesday] is unparseable, because redstone_wire's power is a number between 0 and 15.
Data tags are inside {}. It's optional.
When test for block, only the states provided are tested.
If command tests redstone_wire[power=15], it checks only power, but ignores other states such as north.


=== minecraft:block_state ===
The format of block_state parameters is block_id[block_states]{data_tags}, in which block states and data tags can be omitted when they are not needed.

block_id is required, and it should be in the format of resource location (if namespace isn't set it defaults to minecraft:).
Block states are inside [], comma-separated and must be properties/values supported by the blocks. They are optional.
minecraft:stone[doesntexist=purpleberry] is unparseable, because stone doesn't have doesntexist.
minecraft:redstone_wire[power=tuesday] is unparseable, because redstone_wire's power is a number between 0 and 15.
Data tags are inside {}. It's optional.
When placing blocks, any states provided are set, but anything omitted retain their default values, depending on the block type.
If command sets redstone_wire[power=15], it is set power to 15, but north is a default value (in this case, set to none).

=== minecraft:int_range ===
Must be a range acceptable for integer values. (e.g. 0 - exact match of 0. ..0 - less than or equal to 0. 0.. - more than or equal to 0. 0..1 - between 0 and 1, inclusive.)


=== minecraft:item_predicate ===
The format of item_predicate parameters is item_id{data_tags}, in which data tags can be omitted when not needed.

item_id is required, and it should be in the format of resource location (if namespace isn't set it defaults to minecraft:).
It can also be the resource location of a block tag or item tag with the prefix of #, such as #minecraft:planks.

=== minecraft:particle ===
It must be a resource location of a particle followed by particle parameters that are particle-specific.block, block_marker, and falling_dust has a parameter in block_id[block_state=foo] format to specify a block, in which block states can be omitted when unneeded. For example: /particle block minecraft:grass_block[snowy=true]dust requires three color channel parameters to be set along with the name, representing red, green, and blue, each being a value in the range 0 to 1; and an additional parameter representing size. For example: /particle dust 1.0 0.5 0.5 1.0 creates a pink particle at regular size. If one or more values are greater than 1, the particles change their colors. The greater the values the greater is the range of different colors.dust_color_transition requires three color channel parameters like dust representing the start color, a number parameter representing size, and another three color channel parameters representing the end color. For example: /particle dust_color_transition 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 creates a particle transitioning from red to blue at regular size.item requires an item as a parameter in the format of item_id{NBT}, in which NBT can be omitted when unneeded. It appears, however, that NBT values do not change anything in how the particle looks. For example: /particle item minecraft:applesculk_charge requires a float parameter specifying the angle the particle displays at in radians.shriek requires an int parameter specifying the delay in ticks. For example: /particle shriek 100 creates a shriek particle that doesn't show up until 100 game ticks (5 seconds) in.vibration requires a position parameter representing the destination, and an integer parameter representing the duration of the move. For example: /particle vibration 5.0 64.0 0.0 200 creates a particle taking 200 ticks moving from the current position to 5.0 64.0 0.0.
