== Arguments ==
entity
Specifies the entity or entities to be modified. Must be an entity UUID or the @e target selector.
dataTag
Specifies the data tag elements to be added to, or overwrite elements of, the specified entity (data tags cannot be removed and strings cannot be set to a null value). Must be a compound NBT tag (for example, {CustomName:Steve}).
