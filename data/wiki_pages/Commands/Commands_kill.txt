Kills entities (players, mobs, thrown items, etc.).


== Syntax ==
Java Edition
kill [<targets>]
Bedrock Edition
kill [target: target]


== Arguments ==
JE: <targets>: entityBE: target: target: CommandSelector<Actor>

Specifies the target(s) to kill. If not specified, defaults to the player who executed the command.
Must be a player name, a target selector or a UUID‌. 


== Notes ==
On success, directly kills living targets, even if they are protected by a high-level Resistance effect or by a totem of undying, and issues the appropriate death message. Players and mobs killed this way drop loot, and slimes and magma cubes that are not of minimum size spawn smaller ones. Destroys boats, minecarts, loose items, paintings, armor stands, and experience orbs if they are targeted.
In Bedrock Edition, players in Creative mode cannot be killed.
