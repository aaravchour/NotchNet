Places a configured feature, configured structure feature, structure template, or jigsaw if possible.


== Syntax ==
/place feature <feature> [<pos>]
Place the configured feature.
/place jigsaw <pool> <target> <max_depth> [<position>]
Place the jigsaw.
/place structure <structure> [<pos>]
Place the configured structure feature.
/place template <template> [<pos>] [<rotation>] [<mirror>] [<integrity>] [<seed>]
Place the structure template. (Works like using the load button in the UI for a structure block.)


== Arguments ==
<feature>: resource_key

Specifies the configured feature to place. See Feature for vanilla configured features.
Must be a resource location which will be resolved during command execution into a registry entry in minecraft:worldgen/configured_feature registry.
<structure>: resource_key 

Specifies the configured structure feature. See Generated structures for vanilla structures.
Must be a resource location which will be resolved during command execution into a registry entry in minecraft:worldgen/structure registry.
<pool>: resource_key

Specifies the start structure pool to start generating a jigsaw.
Must be a resource location which will be resolved during command execution into a registry entry in minecraft:worldgen/template_pool registry.
<target>: resource_location 

Specifies the jigsaw block that is connected to when generating the start structure pool.
Must be a resource location which will be resolved during command execution into unregistered content or client-side content.
<max_depth>: integer

Specifies the max depth of the jigsaw.
Must be a  32-bit integer number. And it must be between 1 and 7 (inclusive).
<template>: resource_location

Specifies the structure template to place.
Must be a resource location which will be resolved during command execution into unregistered content or client-side content.
<pos>: block_pos and <position>: block_pos

Specifies the position the placement should be tried.
Must be a block position composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be an integer or a tilde and caret notation.
<rotation>: template_rotation

Specifies the rotation to apply to the placed template.
Must be either none, clockwise_90, counterclockwise_90, or 180. If omitted, defaults to none.
<mirror>: template_mirror

Specifies the mirroring to apply to the placed template.
Must be either none, front_back, or left_right. If omitted, defaults to none.
<integrity>: float

Specifies the integrity value to apply to the placed template (how complete the template that gets placed is). If omitted, defaults to 1.0.
Must be a  Single-precision floating-point format number. And it must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
<seed>: integer

Specifies the seed to use for randomized degradation of the placed template when integrity is less than 1. If omitted, defaults to 0.
Must be a  32-bit integer number.
