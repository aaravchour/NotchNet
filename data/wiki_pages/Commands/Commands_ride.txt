Allows entities to mount or dismount other entities.


== Usage ==

In Java Edition, all types of entities (except marker and player) can ride and be ridden by other entities of any types. Marker and player cannot be ridden.
In Bedrock Edition, an entity cannot ride entities which are not normally rideable for it in vanilla game, which is mainly data driven, controlled by the minecraft:rideable component in the entity files in behavior packs (see Riding#Valid riding combinations in vanilla for details; see also the official doc). In Bedrock Edition, this command can also be used to summon passengers and mounts.

== Example ==
In Java Edition, make the nearest player ride on an nearest arrow:

/ride @p mount @e[type=arrow,sort=nearest,limit=1]

/ride @a[tag=A] summon_ride arrow
In Bedrock Edition, summon a charged creeper at the position of each player who have "A" tag:

/ride @a[tag=A] summon_ride creeper reassign_rides minecraft:become_charged
