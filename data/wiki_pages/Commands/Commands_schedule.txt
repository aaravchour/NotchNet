In Java Edition, delays the execution of a function. The function executes on the server after specified amount of time passes.
In Bedrock Edition, schedules a function to be executed once an area is loaded.


== Syntax ==
Java Edition
schedule function <function> <time> [append|replace]
Adds a schedule.
schedule clear <function>
Removes a schedule.
Bedrock Edition
schedule on_area_loaded add <from: x y z> <to: x y z> <function:filepath>
schedule on_area_loaded add circle <center: x y z> <radius: int> <function: filepath>
schedule on_area_loaded add tickingarea <name: string> <function: filepath>
Adds a schedule to be executed once an area is loaded.


== Arguments ==
JE: <function>: functionBE: function: filepath: CommandFilePath

Specify the function to be run.
In Java Edition, must be a resource location, which refers to a single function, or one prefixed with a #, which refers to a function tag. In Bedrock Edition, must be of the format path/to/function/file, which refers to a function located at [behavior_pack]/functions/path/to/function/file.mcfunction.
JE: <time>: time

Specify the delay time.
It must be a single-precision floating point number suffixed with a unit. Units include:d: an in-game day, 24000 gameticks;s: a second, 20 gameticks;t (default and omitable): a single gametick; the default unit.The time is set to the closest integer tick after unit conversion. For example. .5d is same as 12000 ticks.
JE: <function>: string (in /schedule clear ... mode)

Specify the function to be cleared. Should be a namespaced ID (minecraft: cannot be omitted) or a function tag(minecraft: cannot be omitted).
Must be a string. And it is a greedy phrase (taking the rest of the command as the string argument).
JE: append|replace

replace simply replaces the current function's schedule time (default).
append allows multiple schedules to exist at different times.
BE: from: x y z: CommandPosition and to: x y z: CommandPosition

Specify the coordinates of opposite corners of a rectangular area used to define a loaded area.
Must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be a floating-point number or tilde and caret notation.
For x and z, numbers less than -30,000,000 or greater than 30,000,000 are treated as -30,000,000 or 30,000,000 respectively.
BE: center: x y z: CommandPosition

Specifies the coordinates of the center point of a circular area used to define a loaded area.
Must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be a floating-point number or tilde and caret notation.
For x and z, numbers less than -30,000,000 or greater than 30,000,000 are treated as -30,000,000 or 30,000,000 respectively.
BE: radius: int: int

Specifies the radius of a circular loaded area as the number of chunks from the center to the edge of the circle.
Must be a  32-bit integer number. It should be between 0 and 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).
BE: name: string: basic_string

Specifies the name of a ticking area, executes function when which is added.
It must be either a single word (no spaces) or a quoted string.


== Result ==


== Output ==


== Notes ==
In Java Edition, cannot set two schedules to execute the same function at the same game tick.
In Java Edition, in append mode, scheduling the same function before it is successfully run overwrites the previous schedule. If you schedule a function to happen in 5 seconds, then schedule the same function again before the 5 seconds are up, the new schedule replaces the original.
Even when using the execute as ... command, the scheduled function always runs as the Server at world spawn point.
