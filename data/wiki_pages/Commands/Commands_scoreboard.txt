Must be an arithmetic operator for /scoreboard.Valid values include = (assignment), += (addition), -= (subtraction), *= (multiplication), /= (floor division), %= (modulus), >< (swapping), < (choosing minimum) and > (choosing maximum).
= Assignment: Set target's score to source's score
+= Addition: Add source's score to target's score
-= Subtraction: Subtract source's score from target's score
*= Multiplication: Set target's score to the product of the target's and source's scores
/= Floor division: Divide target's score by source' scores, and the result will be rounded down to an integer.
%= Modulus: Divide target's score by source's score, and use the positive remainder to set the target score
>< Swapping: swaps target's score and source's score
< Choosing minimum: Set target's score to source's score only if source's score is less.
> Choosing maximum: Set target's score to source's score only if source's score is bigger.
In all cases except ><, source's score remains unchanged when performing the operation on a target. If target or source isn't tracked by the specified objective, it will be set to 0. If more than one score holder is specified as sources, performs the operation once with each source's score. If more than one target score holder is specified, performs the operation for each target one by one.
