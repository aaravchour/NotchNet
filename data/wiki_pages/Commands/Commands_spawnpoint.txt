== Syntax ==
Java Edition
spawnpoint [<targets>] [<pos>] [<angle>]
Bedrock Edition
spawnpoint [player: target] [spawnPos: x y z]


== Arguments ==
JE: <targets>: entityBE: player: target: CommandSelector<Player>

Specifies the player whose spawn point should be set. If not specified, defaults to the command's executor.
Must be a player name, a target selector or a UUID‌.  And the target selector must‌/should‌ be of player type.
JE: <pos>: block_posBE: spawnPos: x y z: CommandPositionFloat

Specifies the coordinates of the player's new spawn point. If not specified, defaults to the position of the specified player(s) in Bedrock Edition or the command's execution in Java Edition.
In Java Edition, must be a block position composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be an integer or a tilde and caret notation.
In Bedrock Edition, must be a three-dimensional coordinates with floating-point number elements. Accepts tilde and caret notations.
JE: <angle>: angle

Specifies the yaw angle to spawn with. Defaults to the direction the executor is facing.
Must be a yaw angle, measured in degrees with float number. -180.0 for due north, -90.0 for due east, 0.0 for due south, 90.0 for due west, to 179.9 for just west of due north, before wrapping back around to -180.0. Tilde notation can be used to specify a rotation relative to the execution yaw angle.
