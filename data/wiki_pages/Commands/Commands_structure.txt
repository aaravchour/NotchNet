Used to save and load structures without having to use structure blocks.


== Syntax ==
structure save <name: string> <from: x y z> <to: x y z> [saveMode: StructureSaveMode]
structure save <name: string> <from: x y z> <to: x y z> [includesEntites: Boolean] [saveMode: StructureSaveMode] [includesBlocks: Boolean]
Saves a structure.
structure load <name: string> <to: x y z> [rotation: Rotation] [mirror: Mirror] [includesEntites: Boolean] [includesBlocks: Boolean] [waterlogged: Boolean] [integrity: float] [seed: string]
structure load <name: string> <to: x y z> [rotation: Rotation] [mirror: Mirror] [animationMode: StructureAnimationMode] [animationSeconds: float] [includesEntites: Boolean] [includesBlocks: Boolean] [waterlogged: Boolean] [integrity: float] [seed: string]
Loads a structure.
structure delete <name: string>
Deletes saved structure file.


== Arguments ==

name: string: basic_string

Must be a string. And it must be a single word that has no space or a quoted string.
Should be in the format of name or namespace:name. If namespace is unspecified, defaults to mystructure:
from: x y z: CommandPosition and to: x y z: CommandPosition (in save mode)

Specifies any two opposing corner blocks of the region to be saved.
Must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be a floating-point number or tilde and caret notation.
to: x y z: CommandPosition (in load mode)

Specifies the lower northwest corner of the destination region.
Must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be a floating-point number or tilde and caret notation.
saveMode: StructureSaveMode: enum

Specifies the storage location.
Must be one of disk and memory. If not specified, defaults to memory.
disk saves the structure to the world database itself. After leaving and rejoining the world, the structure save files is still there.
memory only saves the structure in memery temporarily. When leaving and rejoining the world, the structure save files are gone.
includesEntities: Boolean: enum

Specifies whether including entities or not. If unspecified, defaults to true.
Must be a  boolean (either true or false).
rotation: Rotation: enum

Specifies the rotation when loading a structure. If unspecified, defaults to 0_degrees.
Must be one of 0_degrees, 90_degrees, 180_degrees, and 270_degrees.
mirror: Mirror: enum

Specifies the axis of mirror flip when loading a structure. If unspecified, defaults to none.
Must be one of x, z, xz, and none.
animationMode: StructureAnimationMode: enum

Specifies the animation to generate structures.
Must be one of block_by_block and layer_by_layer.
animationSeconds: float: float

Specifies the duration of the animation.
Must be a  Single-precision floating-point format number.
includesBlocks: Boolean: enum

Specifies whether including blocks or not. If unspecified, defaults to true.
Must be a  boolean (either true or false).
integrity: float: float

Specifies the integrity (probability of each block being loaded). If 100, all blocks in the structure are loaded. If 0, no blocks are loaded. If unspecified, defaults to 100.
Must be a  Single-precision floating-point format number. Should be between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
seed: string: basic_string

Specifies the seed when calculating whether a block should be loaded according to integrity. If unspecified, a random seed is taken.
Must be a string. And it must be a single word that has no space or a quoted string.
waterlogged: Boolean: enum

Specifies whether or not waterlog the blocks when the structure is loaded in water. If unspecified, defaults to false.
Must be a  boolean (either true or false).
