Tests whether the blocks in two regions match. Shows the number of matching blocks (the total number of blocks in all mode, or the number of source region non-air blocks in masked mode).


== Syntax ==
testforblocks <begin: x y z> <end: x y z> <destination: x y z> [masked|all]


== Arguments ==
begin: x y z: CommandPosition and end: x y z: CommandPosition

Specifies two opposing corners of the region to use as the pattern to test for (the "source region").
Must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be a floating-point number or tilde and caret notation.
Block position is the coordinates of the point at the lower northwest corner of a block. Because of this, the lesser coordinates of each axis falls right on the region boundary, but the greater coordinates are one block from the boundary, and the block volume of the source region is (xgreater - xlesser + 1) × (ygreater - ylesser + 1) × (zgreater - zlesser + 1). For example, 0 0 0 0 0 0 has a 1-block volume, and 0 0 0 1 1 1 and 1 1 1 0 0 0 both identify the same region with an 8-block volume.
destination: x y z: CommandPosition

Specifies the lower northwestern corner (the corner with the most-negative values) of the region to be checked (the "destination region"). Source and destination regions may overlap.
In Java Edition, must be a block position composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be an integer or a tilde and caret notation. In Bedrock Edition, must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be a floating-point number or tilde and caret notation.
masked|all

Specifies how to match blocks. Must be one of:
all — every block in the source and destination regions must match exactly.
masked — air blocks in the source region will match any block in the destination region.
If not specified, defaults to all.
