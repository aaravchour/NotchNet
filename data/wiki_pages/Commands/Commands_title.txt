Controls text displayed on the screen.


== Usage ==
A screen title is displayed to players as a single line of large center-aligned text in the middle of their displays, and can include a subtitle; a second, separate line of text displayed just below the title. Text can also be printed to the action bar, the space just above the player's hotbar. All of them are specified using raw JSON text components in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, the /title command uses plain text while /titleraw uses raw JSON text components. Screen titles can be set to fade in and fade out, and the duration they are displayed can also be specified. Screen titles scale in size with the GUI Scale, and screen titles that are too big to fit on the screen are not line-wrapped (they just overflow off the screen on both sides).
Note that "fadeIn", "stay", and "fadeOut" values of each player are only stored on their own client side, and these values can be changed only when executing this command. If unchanged, defaults to 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds), 70 game ticks (3.5 seconds), and 20 game ticks (1 second).

JE: <title>: component
BE: titleText: message: CommandMessage or raw json titleText: json: Json::Value

Specifies the text to display as a title, subtitle, or on the action bar.

JE: <fadeIn>: time, <stay>: time and <fadeOut>: time
BE: fadeIn: int: int, stay: int: int, and fadeOut: int: int

Specifies the time for the screen title to fade in, stay, and fade out. In Bedrock Edition, it's specified in game ticks (1/20ths of a second), and values below 0 are treated as 0.
In Java Edition, it must be a single-precision floating point number suffixed with a unit. Units include:d: an in-game day, 24000 gameticks;s: a second, 20 gameticks;t (default and omitable): a single gametick; the default unit.The time is set to the closest integer tick after unit conversion. For example. .5d is same as 12000 ticks.In Bedrock Edition it must be a  32-bit integer number. And it must be between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (inclusive).

All of the following displays a bold screen title "Chapter I" with a gray italic subtitle "The story begins…" to all players.

/title @a title §lChapter I
In Bedrock Edition with raw text variants:
