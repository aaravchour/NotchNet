Whitelist is used to manage server whitelists.
In Java Edition, server operators can always connect when the whitelist is active, even if their profiles do not appear in the whitelist. In Bedrock Edition, players must be whitelisted regardless of operator status. The profiles of the whitelisted players are stored in the whitelist.json or allowlist.json‌ configuration file.
In Minecraft Bedrock version 1.18.10 the whitelist was renamed to allowlist. The old file and command still exist, but have been deprecated.
