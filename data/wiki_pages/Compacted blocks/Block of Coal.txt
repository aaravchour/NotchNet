A block of coal is a storage block, equivalent to nine coal, that can also be used as fuel.


== Obtaining ==
Blocks of coal can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.


=== Crafting ===
Blocks of coal can be crafted only from regular coal, not charcoal. It is crafted in the same way as other mineral blocks.


== Usage ==
Blocks of coal are often used to store coal in a compact fashion, or otherwise used as a fairly cheap construction block.


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Fuel ===
Blocks of coal can be used as fuel in a furnace. One block of coal lasts 800 seconds (16000 ticks), which smelts 80 items. This is ten times the duration of a single piece of coal and 11⁄9 times as efficient (+11.11%) as nine individual pieces of coal—which would only smelt 72 items. The latter, however, prevents inactive furnace use; while smelting one item with one coal wastes seven potential items, smelting one item with one block of coal wastes 79 potential items.


=== Note Blocks ===
Block of coal can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.

== Trivia ==
Blocks of coal cannot be used as fuel for the minecart with furnace.
A full stack of coal blocks should smelt for 14.2 hours – over 42 Minecraft days. That is over fifty times as many items as a lava bucket. However, the player needs 576 coal or 9 stacks of coal to do this.
