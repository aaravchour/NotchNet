A block of emerald is a precious mineral block equivalent to nine emeralds.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Mining blocks of emerald requires an iron pickaxe or better.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
Blocks of emerald are often used to store emeralds in a compact fashion. They are also commonly used as decorative blocks.


=== Beacons ===
Blocks of emerald can be used to "power" a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of emerald blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7, and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely emerald blocks, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of gold, blocks of netherite, and blocks of diamond.

=== Note Blocks ===
A block of emerald can also be used underneath a note block to produce the "bit" sound.
