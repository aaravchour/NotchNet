The Big Workbench Backpack is an item from the Backpacks mod. This item is very similar in functionality to the Workbench Backpack. When used, it will open a 3x3 crafting grid, but will also have 8 inventory slots. Everything in the crafting grid will stay, even when the inventory is closed.
This item was removed in version 3.0.0 of the Backpacks mod.
