The Crafter module is an addon module for minecarts in Steve's Carts that can be used to automatically craft specific items with the resources in its storage modules.


== Recipe ==


== Usage ==

The GUI of the crafter allows you to input ghost items in a crafting grid similar to a Crafting Table. You can remove ghost items by clicking on them.
When a valid recipe has been entered the product will be shown in the output slot, just like in a normal Crafting Table.
Every so often the Crafter will try to craft that recipe. If it succeeds, it will put the product in a storage module. If it doesn't succeed, it doesn't do anything.
