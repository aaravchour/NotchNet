The Curare Bowl is a block from the Tropicraft mod. This block is used to create Curares, which are used in creating Blow Guns and Darts. To create a Curare, use the block with the different required Tropicraft flowers, then stir it with a stick. Eventually a Curare will be created after stirring it.
