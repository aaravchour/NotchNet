The Dynamic Calculator is a machine added by Calculator. It combines the functionality of the Calculator, Scientific Calculator and Atomic Calculator in a single block. In addition, it doesn't require Redstone Flux to function, unlike the Calculator or Scientific Calculator.
The Dynamic Calculator cannot automatically input or output items, and unlike its predecessors cannot be placed on a Docking Station to do so.
