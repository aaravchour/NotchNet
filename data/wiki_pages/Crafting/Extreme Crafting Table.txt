The Extreme Crafting Table (previously named the Dire Crafting Table) is a block added by Avaritia. It functions as a 9x9 slot version of the Crafting Table, but things normally crafted in the Crafting Table cannot be made in it.
Crafting in the Extreme Crafting Table is referred to as "Extreme Crafting". Before version of the mod (1.0), no recipes were added; any recipes added to the Extreme Crafting Table were done through MineTweaker or via the mod's API.
