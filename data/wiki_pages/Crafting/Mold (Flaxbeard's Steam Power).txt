This page is about the Flaxbeard's Steam Power Mold. For other uses, see Mold.

The Mold is a block from Flaxbeard's Steam Power. It is used to turn liquid metal in the Crucible into usable plates, ingots, or nuggets. It requires a Plate Mold, Nugget Mold, or Ingot Mold in it. It must be placed in a way that the Crucible will tilt towards it when used. Only a single mold can be made before the output item must be extracted, either through opening it or using pipes.
