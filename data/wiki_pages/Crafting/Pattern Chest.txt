The Pattern Chest is a block from Tinkers' Construct. It can store tool part casts and patterns. A single Pattern Chest can only store either casts or patterns—if it contains a cast, patterns cannot be put into it, and vice versa. It dynamically adds slots to itself when anything is added to it, so it only ever shows a single empty slot. It is accessible from adjacent Part Builders and Stencil Tables.
