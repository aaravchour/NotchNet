The Sun Collector, also commonly referred to as a Sunlight Collector, is a block from Witchery. This block is used with Quartz Spheres and a Daylight Sensor to create Sun Grenades. Sun Collectors must be placed adjacent to a Daylight Sensor in order to function. Four collectors can be used with a single sensor. A Quartz Sphere can be placed in the collectors to create Sun Grenades. The collectors will absorb sunlight at around mid-day, and convert the spheres to grenades. The spheres will be consumed in the process, but can be re-obtained by using the grenades. 
This block is required in order for the player to become a level 5 vampire.
