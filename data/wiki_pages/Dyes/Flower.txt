Flowers are non-solid plants that occur in a variety of shapes and colors. They are primarily used for decoration and crafted into dyes.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===

Flowers can be broken instantly with any item or by hand. Harvesting a flower with shears consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit. In Bedrock Edition, harvesting two-high flowers with a Fortune-enchanted tool may increase the yield (for example, up to 7 sunflowers per harvested sunflower).
A flower also breaks if water runs over its location, or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location.


=== Natural generation ===
Most flowers generate naturally in vegetation features on dirt and grass blocks. Even in a biome covered with snow, flowers generate naturally on dirt blocks with grass, despite the adjoining dirt blocks being covered with snow. See vegetation for the types of flowers which can naturally spawn in each biome when a new chunk is generated. 
Potted dandelions, poppies, blue orchids, alliums, azure bluets, red and white tulips, and oxeye daisies can be found in woodland mansions.
Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages; poppies in plains, savanna, taiga, and snowy plains‌ villages; oxeye daisies, cornflowers, and azure bluets in plains villages.
Cactus Flowers naturally generate on 2 to 3 blocks tall cacti in deserts and badlands.
Eyeblossoms naturally generate in the Pale Garden.


==== Flower gradients ====


=== Mob loot ===
Iron golems drop 0 to 2 poppies upon death. This is unaffected by the Looting enchantment.
An enderman holding a small flower drops the flower upon death.
Any mob killed by the wither drops one wither rose upon death. If possible, the wither rose is placed on the block where the mob died. If the flower cannot be placed there, or if /gamerule mobGriefing is set to false, the flower is dropped as an item instead. Wither roses are dropped even when /gamerule doMobLoot is set to false.
In Java Edition, baby villagers may give a poppy to players with the Hero of the Village effect.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Trading ===
Wandering traders may sell any flowers except wither roses for a single emerald. In Java Edition, they cannot sell sunflowers, rose bushes, lilacs, or peonies.


=== Sniffers ===
When sniffers dig out the dirt with their big beaked snouts, there is a chance to get either Torchflower Seeds and Pitcher Pods. These ancient seeds, when planted on farmland, can grow into torchflowers and pitcher plants. 


=== Post-generation ===
When bone meal is applied to a grass block, flowers have a chance of generating instead of tall grass on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in 15×5×15‌/7×5×7‌. The generated flower depends on both the biome and the X/Y/Z coordinates. Double flowers cannot be obtained this way.
In Bedrock Edition, when bone meal is applied to any single high flower (except wither roses) that has been placed or generated on top of a grass block, more flowers appear around it without grass. With the exception of dandelions and poppies, the flowers that form around are the same type as the original flower. In the case of dandelions, poppies occasionally appear, and vice versa for poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.
Applying bone meal to a double flower results in the flower dropping a copy of itself. This is the only renewable way to obtain double flowers.


==== Flower biomes ====
The following table is those which can spawn when using bone meal. See also vegetation for the types of flowers which can naturally spawn in each biome when a new chunk is generated. 


== Usage ==

All kinds of flowers can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, moss, pale moss or mud. Wither roses can also be planted on netherrack or soul sand. In Java Edition, wither roses can also be planted on soul soil. One-block-tall flowers can be planted in a flower pot.
Most kinds of flowers can be crafted into dyes or used to craft suspicious stew.
Because flowers are non-solid transparent blocks, they can be used (like torches) to break blocks that fall on them, such as sand.


=== Bees ===
Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with flowers, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.


=== Navigation ===
Sunflowers always face east, making them useful for navigation if the sun is not visible. This also works in the Nether and the End.


=== Breeding ===
Dandelions can be used to breed, grow, and lead rabbits. Any flower can be used for bees, including wither roses.


=== Damaging ===
When not in Peaceful difficulty, wither roses inflict the Wither status effect to any players or non-immune mobs touching it, dealing 1 damage every half second‌ or two seconds.‌ The effect lingers for 1 second after the player/mob leaves its block space. Wither skeletons, the wither, and the ender dragon are not affected due to their Wither immunity.
When placed in a flower pot, wither roses do not cause damage to any entity.


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Suspicious stew ===

All small flowers can be used to create suspicious stew. When a flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that flower the next time it is milked with a bowl. The mooshroom returns to producing mushroom stew until fed another flower. Eating one restores 6 () hunger and 7.2 hunger saturation, as well as producing a brief status effect.

Using different flowers results in different effects. All are short-lived, but some have lasting effects: The regeneration restores 2 or 3 health; Wither or poison inflicts up to 2 hearts damage. The saturation effectively makes those stews a superfood: they restore up to 6 hunger and 12 saturation points on top of their food value, for a total of 12 ( × 6) and over 19 points of saturation.


=== Composting ===
Placing a flower into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of flowers yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.


=== Bee nests ===
Oak and birch trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flower have a 5% chance to grow with bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

Issues relating to "Flower" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.


== Trivia ==
When Notch made the dandelion (the texture in the Programmer Art pack), he used the rose as a base for its texture.
Peonies were used at Jeb's wedding, and the Oxeye Daisy was named for his first game company, Oxeye Games Studio.
Rose bushes do not apply damage when walked through, despite roses having thorns.
Allium is a genus composed of bulb vegetables such as onions, garlic, and related vegetables, which have large, pink inflorescences resembling that of the in-game flower.
Wither roses deal the same damage while in contact (and a second more) as magma blocks, via the Wither status effect.
In Bedrock Edition, crimson and warped roots are in the "Flower" section of the inventory.
Unlike both parts of its name suggests, the azure bluets are not blue in Minecraft. In real life, their pale-blue color looks light grey at a distance.
In real life, cornflowers got their name because they used to be a common weed on crop fields.
Before they were added to Minecraft, white flowers were already present in Minicraft.
Torchflowers are based off kniphofia genus of perennial flowering plants, which can be similarly called "torch lilies" as a common name.
However, they do not give off actual light when planted. Torch flowers are not like torches.
Open Eyeblossoms has orange eyes similar to the Creaking.
