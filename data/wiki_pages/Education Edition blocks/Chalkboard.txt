A chalkboard is a unique block that can display more text than a sign. Three sizes are available: 1×1 (slate), 2×1 (poster), and 3×2 (board).


== Obtaining ==
In Education Edition, chalkboards can be obtained in the Creative inventory or through the /give command.
In Bedrock Edition, chalkboards cannot be obtained by commands or the creative inventory, and can only be obtained by using glitches or inventory editors.


== Usage ==
A chalkboard can be used similarly to a sign, to display text. Once placed, select the chalkboard and enter the desired text and click the "OK" button. The "×" in the upper right corner of the board closes the edit screen. The only difference is the inability to dye text and the ability to live edit text.


=== Placement ===
Chalkboards may be placed on the top or side of other blocks (including non-solid blocks like fences, glass, rails, and other chalkboards). To place a chalkboard, use a chalkboard item while pointing at the block the chalkboard should be attached to. To place a chalkboard on a block that can be interacted with by the use control (for example, chests, note blocks, etc.), sneak while placing the chalkboard.
1×1 slates placed on the top of a block stand on a short post, facing in the direction of the player who placed it, in any of 16 different directions. 2×1 posters and 2×3 boards can be placed in any of 4 different directions. Chalkboards placed on the side of a block simply float there, even if the block doesn't make contact with the chalkboards.


=== Text ===
When entering text, six lines of text are available for the slates and posters, while fifteen lines of text are available for the 2×3 boards. To switch between lines, the player can press Enter or the up/down arrow keys. The location of text currently selected has a flashing cursor.
While editing, typing and backspacing can occur at any point in the line by moving the cursor using the left and right arrow keys. Once the end of the line has been reached, the word is hyphenated and is continued on the next line.
After the editing window is closed, right-clicking on a chalkboard reopens the editing menu. Copy and paste can be performed, and no more than the basic/shifted keyboard characters may be entered.


=== Interaction ===
Chalkboards act as though they have a use action, so sneaking is required to place blocks or use items while the cursor is pointed at them.
Unlike signs, boards block a piston from moving.
Boards have no collision box (they are completely non-solid), so items and mobs can move through boards blocks. Other blocks (including other boards) can be placed on any edge of a board.
Water and lava flow around boards. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to boards as if the boards were flammable, but the boards do not burn.
