An underwater torch is a non-solid block that emits light underwater.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Unlike a normal torch, an underwater torch does not break if water occupies its space.
Like normal torches, an underwater torch breaks instantly and drops itself when broken using anything. Tools do not lose durability when breaking an underwater torch.
Underwater torches are also broken if pushed by a piston.


=== Crafting ===

As with any torch, an underwater torch can be crafted using coal or charcoal. The player can also use a torch from the Creative inventory.


== Usage ==
An underwater torch can be used exactly like a normal torch, only it can be underwater.

Underwater torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some require sneaking (see placement for exceptions). Being non-solid, an underwater torch has no collision box.
Gravity-affected blocks like sand and gravel do not fall if the block below them has an underwater torch on it, and they break if they fall onto an underwater torch.


=== Placement ===
In general, underwater torches can be placed only on solid, opaque, and full blocks; exceptions are listed below.


=== Light ===
Underwater torches emit a light level of 14. Underwater torches also melt snow layers and ice within 2 blocks (taxicab distance).

== Trivia ==
The crafting recipe refers to the fact that magnesium metal can burn in pure water vapor. Magnesium has a similar reaction with hot water, but it is slower and does not look like burning.
If magnesium catches fire, water cannot be used to extinguish it. This is because magnesium reacts with hot water (and water vapor) to form explosive hydrogen gas.
