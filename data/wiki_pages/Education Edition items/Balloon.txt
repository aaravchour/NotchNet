Balloons are entities that float upward when placed.


== Obtaining ==
Balloons are available in the Creative inventory or commands in Education Edition only.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
When used on a mob, a fence, or a wall, balloons attach to the mob or block, similarly to a lead. Balloons float into the air faster than the speed the player flies up, but remain grounded if tied to a fence. If tied to a mob, the balloon floats away and carries the mob into the air, before both eventually despawn or disappear.

When a balloon is shot by an arrow or a trident, or floats into a solid block, it pops, summons particles, and is destroyed. It drops nothing. A balloon tied to a fence post bursts when a player strikes it in any direction.
