Compounds are a type of item from Education Edition used in chemistry, which are created from combinations of various elements.


== Obtaining ==
Compounds cannot be obtained in the Creative inventory. They are only obtained from creating them in the compound creator. This is done by inserting a certain number of elements corresponding to the compound's chemical formula.

Natural compounds are compounds which can be obtained naturally in Minecraft.


=== Garbage ===
Garbage is considered a "compound", but the only way to produce it is to activate the Lab Table when its inputs are an invalid recipe. It has no uses.


== Usage ==
Certain compounds are used as ingredients in crafting or lab table experiments. Natural compounds have uses outside of chemistry, detailed in their respective articles.

== Unused compound textures ==
In the chemistry resource pack folder, there are numerous compound textures which are not used in the game. Note: a compound item with a data value of 38 will have the Blue Flask texture and will be called item.compound..name. If you use an NBT Editor to get a compound item with no assigned data value (by deleting the data tag) and then transfer that item to another world / realm using structure blocks (by exporting to a .mcstructure file, then importing it on another world or realm) then it will be renamed to Ivory Tusk.
