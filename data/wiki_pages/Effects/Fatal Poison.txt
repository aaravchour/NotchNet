Fatal Poison inflicts damage to entities over time, and can kill both undead and non-undead mobs, similar to Wither. The effect is actually called "Poison," but its ID distinguishes it from the other Poison effect, which cannot kill.


== Effect ==
The amount of damage inflicted on the affected entity is shown in the table below:

The player's hearts turn yellow-green ( × 10).
Amplifiers outside the range 0–31 (corresponding to levels 1–32) are treated modulo 32 (as though reduced by 32 until they are within the range, or as the remainder from division by 32, i.e. 33 is treated as 1.)


== Causes ==

Feeding a cookie to a parrot instantly applies the Fatal Poison effect to the parrot, causing it to die shortly after.


== Immune mobs ==
Boss mobs and witches are unaffected by this status effect.


== Death message ==
If the player is killed by Fatal Poison, the death message "<player> was killed by magic" appears, as when killed by a potion of Harming.
