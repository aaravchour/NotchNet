Poison is an effect that inflicts damage over time. It is similar to Wither, but it drains health faster and it cannot kill (it will, however, reduce the player's health all the way to 1 ()).
It can be cured by drinking milk, honey or antidote.‌


== Effect ==
The amount of damage inflicted to the affected entity is shown in the table below:

The player's hearts turn yellow-green ()( on hardcore mode).
The damage stops when the affected entity is at 1 () health, but can resume if healing occurs and the affected entity is at more than 1 () health before the effect expires. 
Amplifiers outside the range 0–31 (corresponding to levels 1–32) are treated modulo 32 (as though reduced by 32 until they are within the range, or alternatively as the remainder from the division by 32, i.e. 33 or 65 is treated as 1).
The effect can be removed by drinking milk or honey. In  Minecraft Education and Bedrock Edition when education options are enabled, drinking antidote also removes poison.

== Trivia ==
According to most medical and zoological terminology, "poison" specifically refers to a toxin that is delivered to an organism via contact or ingestion. As bees, cave spiders, and poison tipped arrows inject the player with toxins rather, they deliver venom, not poison.
Pufferfish are both venomous and poisonous in-game, while real-life pufferfish are poisonous but not venomous, and their spines are used only for intimidation purposes.
