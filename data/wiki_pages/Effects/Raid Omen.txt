The Raid Omen is a status effect that replaces the Bad Omen effect when a player enters a village.
The effect lasts 30 seconds. If a player didn't remove it in time, it will trigger a raid. However, this rule isn't always absolute. Sometimes, the timer starts as soon as the player reaches the village's borders.
