Resistance is a status effect that reduces incoming damage.


== Effect ==
Resistance reduces incoming damage by 20% × level from all sources except for starvation, the void, /kill, and explosions with extreme power values (negative values (128 to 255 (mod 256) or -128 to -1 (mod 256)) stored in an NBT, see entity format) such as creepers and ghast fireballs.
Resistance is applied only to the remaining damage after all other damage reductions (armor and enchantments), but before rounding down to a whole number. This means any equipped armor pieces still lose the usual amount of durability, even at level 5+ where the potion effect grants complete immunity to most sources.


== Causes ==


== Immune mobs ==
Withers and ender dragons are immune to Resistance; it grants no benefit to them.


== Notes ==
Level 5+ gives the player or mob full immunity to all damage, with the exceptions mentioned earlier.
