Saturation is an instant status effect that reduces the need for eating. It also prevents death by hunger if the player has no food.


== Effect ==
The Saturation effect instantly replenishes 1 () × level and 2 × level points of saturation.
If the effect lasts longer than one tick, the player continues gaining food points and saturation points, 1 food point and 2 saturation points on each tick, with 20 ticks (1 second) completely replenishing the hunger bar. 
Negative levels decrease hunger and saturation.

== Notes ==
All foods replenish food saturation, but none actually add the Saturation status effect, with the exception of suspicious stew crafted with a dandelion or blue orchid.
