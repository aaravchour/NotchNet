Weakness is an effect that decreases melee damage. It is required to cure zombie villagers.


== Effect ==
Melee damage inflicted by the affected entity is reduced by 4 × level in Java Edition. Negative levels increase melee damage dealt.
In Bedrock Edition, melee damage under the Weakness effect can be found through the equation

 is the default attack damage with whatever weapon or tool is used to attack.
Attacks with a damage of 0 or lower would be ignored entirely, however in Bedrock Edition, the use of enchantments such as Sharpness will allow damage to still be dealt.
This effect is also used to cure zombie villagers, preceding the golden apple.
The effect can be removed by drinking milk. In  Minecraft Education and Bedrock Edition when education options are enabled, drinking elixir also removes weakness.
