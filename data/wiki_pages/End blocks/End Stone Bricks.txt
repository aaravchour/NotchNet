End stone bricks are an end stone-based brick.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
End stone bricks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.


=== Natural generation ===
End stone bricks can be found naturally as part of the structure of end cities.


=== Crafting ===


=== Stonecutting ===


== Usage ==
End stone bricks are primarily decorative blocks, similarly to other brick-type blocks.
Like raw end stone, end stone bricks have a blast resistance stronger than most other stone variants, except bedrock and obsidian. However, unlike end stone, end stone bricks can be destroyed by the ender dragon.
