=== Fuel ===
They can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block. As fuel, it is more efficient to use bamboo planks rather than using block of bamboo. 2 bamboo planks can smelt 3 items, but a block of bamboo can only smelt 1.5 items and 9 harvested bamboo smelts 2.25 items.
Unlike logs, blocks of bamboo cannot be smelted into charcoal.


=== Note blocks ===
Block of bamboo can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
