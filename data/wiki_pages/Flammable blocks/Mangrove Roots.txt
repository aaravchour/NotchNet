Mangrove roots are blocks that form as part of mangrove trees. Despite being a full block, they can be waterlogged.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Mangrove roots can be broken by hand, but using an axe is quickest. Mangrove roots drop themselves when broken with any tool.


=== Natural generation ===
Mangrove roots are generated in mangrove swamp biomes.


=== Post-generation ===
When mangrove propagules grow, they develop roots that can vary in size.


== Usage ==
Mangrove roots can be waterlogged, despite being a full block. Water does not spread out‌ and waterlogged mangrove roots follow the same mechanics as any other waterlogged block.
Mobs do spawn on mangrove roots.


=== Redstone ===
Redstone circuits can pass their power level through mangrove roots and power other redstone components that are adjacent to the block, even when waterlogged.‌


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Composting ===
Mangrove roots have a 30% chance of increasing the compost level in a composter by 1.


=== Note blocks ===
Mangrove roots can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.


=== Fuel ===
When used in a furnace as fuel, mangrove roots last 15 seconds (smelting up to 1.5 items).‌
