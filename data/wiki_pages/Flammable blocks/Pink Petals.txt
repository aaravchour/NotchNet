Pink petals are a decorative block that generates in cherry grove biomes.


== Appearence ==
Pink Petals consists of small and big Cherry flowers and petals.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Pink petals can be broken instantly with any item or by hand. Harvesting pink petals with shears consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.
Pink petals also break if water runs over its location, or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location.


=== Natural generation ===
Pink petals generate naturally in cherry groves.
If a village should appear in a cherry grove biome, it is possible for the petals to be growing on dirt path blocks, similarly to grass.


=== Post-generation ===
Each time bone meal is applied to pink petals, the number of petals in the block increases by 1. If there are already four pink petals in the block, it will drop a copy of itself, similar to tall flowers.
Pink petals also generate when bone meal is applied to a grass block in cherry groves.


== Usage ==
A pink petal may be placed on grass block, podzol, mycelium, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, moss block, mud, muddy mangrove roots, or farmland. Pink petals are used for decoration, and can be crafted into pink dye.
More than one pink petal can be placed on a block, similarly to other blocks such as sea pickles and candles. Up to four pink petals can be placed in a group on one block. 
Sheep can consume the grass under pink petals without breaking them.


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Bees ===
Bees can pollinate pink petals like other flowers. They can also be bred using pink petals.
