A target is a block that produces a temporary redstone signal when hit by a projectile. Unlike most other conductive blocks it also redirects adjacent redstone dust towards it.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===
A target can be found in ancient cities.


=== Breaking ===
Targets can be mined using any tool or by hand, but a hoe is the fastest way to break it.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
Targets emit a redstone signal when hit by most projectiles. This includes arrows, tridents, eggs, snowballs, splash potions, fire charges fired by a dispenser, firework rockets, lingering potions, bottles o' enchanting, ender pearls, shulker bullets, and llama spit. The closer a projectile is to the center of the block, the stronger the redstone signal that is produced.


=== Redstone component ===
When struck by most projectiles, the target emits redstone power for 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds). Arrows and tridents instead cause the target to emit power for 10 redstone ticks (1 second), similar to stone buttons. A target can be hit with any of the projectiles mentioned above.
The strength of the signal depends on how close the projectile is to the center of the block, from 1 to 15.
The target also provides a block update when hit, meaning that an observer can detect if the target has been hit and has produced a redstone signal.‌
When used as part of a redstone circuit, a target has the unique property that, though being an opaque block that is not a mechanism component, still can redirect adjacent redstone dust to point to itself.
