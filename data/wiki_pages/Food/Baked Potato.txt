A baked potato is a food item that can be eaten by the player.


== Obtaining ==
Baked potatoes can be obtained by cooking potatoes in a furnace, smoker, or campfire.

In Java Edition, baked potatoes can also be obtained by killing a zombie or one of its variants while it is on fire. The drop chance is still affected by Looting.
