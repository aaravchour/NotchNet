A milk bucket is a drink obtained from using a bucket on cows, mooshrooms and goats that can be consumed to clear all effects.


== Obtaining ==


=== Harvesting ===
Milk buckets can be obtained from cows, mooshrooms, and goats by pressing use while looking at them with an empty bucket.


=== Mob loot ===
A milk bucket has a chance of dropping from a wandering trader, if the trader is killed while holding it.‌


== Usage ==
Holding use with a milk bucket starts the drinking sound and animation. In Java Edition, the animation is shown only in first-person camera mode.
When consumed, milk immediately removes all status effects from the player. Fire is not a status effect; therefore, drinking milk doesn't extinguish a burning player.
The benefits of area status effects granted by beacons and conduit power are restored almost immediately in Bedrock Edition and after a few seconds in Java Edition.
