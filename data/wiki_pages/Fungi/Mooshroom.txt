Mooshrooms are mushroom-covered variants of cows exclusive to the rare mushroom fields biome. Although they look similar to cows, they are not cows.


== Spawning ==
Red mooshrooms can spawn in mushroom fields biomes in herds of 4–8 when the light level is 9 or higher and on mycelium. They do not naturally spawn in any other biome. A red mooshroom transforms into a brown mooshroom (and vice versa) when it is struck by lightning. Brown mooshrooms never spawn naturally. Red mooshrooms have a 5% chance of spawning as babies. Cows do not spawn in mushroom fields biomes.


=== Breeding ===

A pair of mooshrooms can breed after being given wheat. A mooshroom cannot be bred with a cow unless the mooshroom has been sheared.
Feeding wheat to a calf shortens its growing time by 10% of the remaining time. Baby mooshrooms do not have mushrooms on their backs. Mushrooms appear once the baby grows to an adult. Breeding two red mooshrooms has a 1⁄1024 chance to spawn a brown baby variant and vice versa.
When breeding a red mooshroom and a brown mooshroom together, there is a 50% chance for the baby mooshroom to be either red or brown.


== Drops ==
When an adult mooshroom is killed, it drops:

1 Raw Beef (Steak if killed while on fire). The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1-6 with Looting III.
0–2 Leather. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.
1–3 (when killed by a player or tamed wolf)
Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.
Shearing a mooshroom drops 5 corresponding mushrooms and turns the mooshroom into a normal cow, emitting a smaller version of the
explosion particle. The mushrooms don't grow back. This implies that mooshrooms are normal cows that have been infected with mushrooms.
Like other baby animals, killing a baby mooshroom yields no items or experience.


== Behavior ==
Mooshrooms have the same AI behavior as cows: they walk around slowly and aimlessly, huffing and mooing occasionally. They avoid danger such as cliffs, fire, or lava, but make no attempt to stay out of water. Although they behave similarly to cows, it is important to note that they are not the same as cows.
A mooshroom follows a player holding wheat. A lightning strike on a mooshroom switches its color, from red to brown, or brown to red.


=== Milking ===
A mooshroom can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket. Mooshrooms can also be milked using bowls to get mushroom stew.
When a small flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that small flower the next time it is milked with a bowl. Red mooshrooms do not produce suspicious stew. The brown mooshroom returns to producing mushroom stew until fed another small flower. The small flowers produce the suspicious stew with the following effects.

== Trivia ==

Mooshrooms are the fourth mob in the game that are directly affected by being struck by lightning.
In Minecraft Earth, there was a buttercup-covered variant of mooshrooms known as "mooblooms". This variant was also part of the Minecraft Live 2020 Mob Vote. It came last and there are currently no plans to add it to the game.
