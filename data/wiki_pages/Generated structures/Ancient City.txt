An ancient city is a palatial structure found in deep dark biomes at Y level -51, harboring chests containing some items that cannot be found anywhere else.


== Structure ==


=== Environment aesthetics ===
An ancient city features a very large palace with a footprint of around 220 blocks on each horizontal axis, stretching throughout a deep dark biome. The floor of the city always generates at the Y level of -51. The palace is made up of long corridors with 2-block-deep layers of gray wool on the floor, and some rugs made of blue, light blue and cyan wool or carpet floors to prevent vibrations, as well as some smaller ruins off to the side of the main corridors, which contain either one or two loot chests. The city has statues and the center features a frame resembling a warden's head, where there are reinforced deepslate blocks, which is an unobtainable material in Survival mode. Other unique blocks such as soul lanterns and candles as well as different forms of deepslate and sculk can be found here. Sculk shriekers generate much more frequently in ancient cities than in the normal deep dark biome.
Some structures resemble elements of the game. The city center bears a resemblance to early iterations of the warden's design, and other structures resemble pillager outposts and woodland mansion rooms.

==== Redstone circuits ====
Underneath the frame at the city center lies a series of hidden basements with naturally generating redstone circuitry.
The secret entrance is located at the base of the structure, underneath the wooden bridge between the city center and the wall. There's a piston door that is controlled by a sculk sensor in the redstone circuits in the basement.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

For city_center_1, there is a chiseled deepslate block in front of the frame. Making a vibration around it can activate the sculk sensor and then open the piston door. There's also a pulse extender between the sculk sensor and piston door, which makes the piston door close 180 game ticks after the sculk sensor is deactivated.
The circuit in city_center_2 is similar to the former, but with a signal strength filter. Only vibrations with a frequency equal to 8 (mob interactions, projectile hits, eating, entity damage) can activate the piston door. Creating these vibrations on the path in the front of the frame in the city center activates the door.
For city_center_3, making a vibration on the path in front of the frame on the city center can activate the sculk sensor. Additionally, there's a T flip-flop between the sculk sensor and piston door. After the sculk sensor is activated, the piston door remains open until the sculk sensor is activated again.
There are three basic redstone circuits in the basement:

== Trivia ==
The ancient cities were inspired by Mayan and Roman ruins. In some concept art, Narrator revealed that the loot in ancient cities was originally going to be stored within jar-shaped pots, screaming vases, and stone chests.
The intention of the ancient cities was to capture a feeling of something that feels like it was once bustling with life, but is now vacant and lifeless.
