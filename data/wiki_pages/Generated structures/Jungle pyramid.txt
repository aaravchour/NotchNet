Jungle pyramids‌ or jungle temples‌ are structures found in jungles.


== Generation ==
Jungle pyramids/temples can generate in jungles and bamboo jungles‌, but not sparse jungles.


== Structure ==

Jungle pyramids/temples consist of cobblestone, mossy cobblestone and vines. There are 3 floors. 
It is possible to find blocks that normally generate outside the pyramid/temple (like leaves) appearing inside, possibly blocking the chests or dispensers, or interrupting the redstone.


=== Puzzle ===

On the bottom floor, there is a puzzle consisting of 3 levers on 3 chiseled stone bricks connected to a hidden piston trapdoor mechanism. If the combination is entered correctly, a block on the main floor is pulled away, revealing a chest.


=== Trap ===
Down the hall from the puzzle, there is another chest. There are two tripwire lines connected to dispensers with 2–14 arrows, hidden behind vines. The first tripwire is in the middle of the hallway and the second tripwire is around the corner in front of the chest. Walking over the tripwire triggers the dispenser attached to it. Breaking the tripwire with anything other than shears also triggers it.
