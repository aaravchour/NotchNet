A pillager outpost is an assortment of structures inhabited by pillagers. 


== Generation ==
Pillager outposts are semi-rare structures, generating every several hundred to couple thousand blocks. This makes them rarer than villages but less rare than woodland mansions.
Pillager outposts can generate naturally in any village-generating biome, including:

Plains
Desert
Savanna
Taiga
Snowy Plains
Snowy Taiga‌
Sunflower Plains‌
Meadow
Pillager outposts also generate in the following biomes, where villages do not spawn:

Grove
Snowy Slopes
Jagged Peaks
Frozen Peaks
Stony Peaks
Cherry Grove‌
In Java Edition, pillager outposts never generate too close to, or within, villages. They can do so in Bedrock Edition as well as generate far away from villages.
In Java Edition, if an outpost spawns in the water or in the air (e.g., spawning near a savanna plateau), then a platform of grass (or sand), dirt, and stone spawns underneath it in a circular shape. This also applies to the smaller structures such as tents, targets, log piles, and cages. On occasion, the smaller structures still spawn in the air despite having a platform below them, depending on how high up they are.
In Bedrock Edition, pillager outposts generate with foundations similar to that of a woodland mansion: watchtowers use cobblestone, birch planks, and dark oak logs as their foundation; tents and cages generate dark oak planks as their foundation; log piles use horizontal dark oak logs as their foundation; and targets generate cobblestone as a foundation.
The outpost tower generates each time. Up to 4 other smaller structures may spawn around the periphery of the main outpost structure.
Eight extra air blocks also generate around the outpost.


== Mobs ==

Iron golems and allays spawn only during the generation of the outpost structures. An iron golem has a 85% chance of spawning. Meanwhile, the allay has a 50% chance of spawning. These mobs spawn in cages. The iron golem can punch  pillagers who are one block away from the fences of the cage. 
Both regular pillagers and pillager captains can continuously spawn around the structure. Pillagers can still spawn if a player is inside the tower. In Java Edition they spawn in a 72×54×72 area centered on the top level of the watchtower, the same level as the chest. In Bedrock Edition, they spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost; specifically, they choose the northwest corner of the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top.
In Java Edition, only pillagers may spawn within a pillager outpost spawn area. Pillagers may naturally spawn on any valid opaque block (except leaves) as long as the block light level is 8 or less. They cannot, however, spawn on blocks that emit a light level of 14 or greater. There is a 6% chance a pillager will spawn as a patrol leader.
In Java Edition, there are 15 jigsaw blocks that can generate the structures around the tower. Each structure has a 1 in 13 chance of being generated, including allay and iron golem cages. When generated, iron golem cages spawn one golem, and allay cages spawn two allays.
A total of eight pillagers, including the pillager captain, spawns in a pillager outpost.


=== Bad Omen ===
Upon killing an outpost captain, the player receives 1 level of the Bad Omen effect applied to them for 100 minutes (5 in-game days) (1.20 and below). In 1.21 and above, the player upon killing an outpost captain will receive 1 ominous bottle. 


== Structure ==

A pillager outpost consists of a 4 level watchtower with other smaller structures around it.
Structure blocks can be used to manually load pieces of the pillager outpost from the /data/minecraft/structures/pillager_outpost folder in minecraft.jar. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter pillager_outpost/<structure_name>, and press LOAD.

== Trivia ==
Pillager outposts are the only natural source of Dark oak wood and its products in the biomes it spawns in( Pillager outposts don't spawn in Dark oak forests)
A pillager outpost's base may be extended to help it stand without removing/obstructing terrain. This is common in Bedrock Edition due to the glitches in terrain generation that version faces.
Pillager outposts are missing two blocks on one of the pillars for the roof, making the struture asymmetrical.
