The starting house was a structure which acted as the starting place when first spawned in a Java Edition Indev world. This was also, technically, the first "structure" added to Minecraft. (Even though it might as well be considered as a Feature)


== Generation ==
When creating a new world, the player spawned inside the starting house located in the centre of the world.


== Structure ==

It was a 7 block wide × 7 block long × 4 block tall structure, with a 1×2 hole for players to exit and two torches on the interior. When starting houses were added, they were made of mossy cobblestone (which was unavailable naturally on the map anywhere else) and 4 chests, one filled with TNT, one with a full stack (99 at the time) of every type of block, another with every type of item and one filled with every color of wool. As Indev progressed from testing items and blocks to testing the actual survival aspect, these chests were removed. Later, the design of the house was changed. The floor was changed to stone and the walls and roof were changed to planks.
