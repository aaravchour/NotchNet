Community Celebration was an event that took place between December 8, 2020 and January 13, 2021. During the event, players were able to claim and download four maps made by the community for free, as well as new character creator items, for Bedrock Edition. Players on Java Edition were also able to redeem free content, as well as a free week of Realms. The content was made by community creators PixelHeads, Noxcrew, Gamemode One, Mithey, and Jigarbov Productions. Mojang Studios ran the event in order to thank the community for investing time and talent into the game.
