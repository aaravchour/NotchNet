This page documents Java Edition​'s several historical leaf decay algorithms.


== Indev 20100218 - Indev 20100223 ==
Leaves will NOT decay if:

They are within a 5x5x2 box around a log with the log in the bottom center. (Note that the leaf does not have to touch the log)
They are on top of a solid block.
They are on top of a leaf that is unable to decay due to the reasons above.
If these conditions are not met, the leaf decays.

== Alpha v1.0.6_01 - Alpha v1.1.2_01 ==
In Alpha, leaves would decay using an algorithm that checks whether it has a solid or leaf block underneath it or is adjacent to a solid block. If it doesn't, it must be connected to a leaf block that is also supported as long as it is no further than five blocks away from said support.
