The terrain generator was made infinite in mid-2014 with the addition of biomes from the then Java 1.7.2 generator. This world generator remained identical until Caves and Cliffs Part 2 was released in late 2021.


=== Mountainous Bedrock Edition-era Terrain ===


== Legacy Console Edition ==

Legacy Console Edition was historically updated roughly following Java Edition major releases, and as such, mirrored Java Edition changes for much of its update history.


=== Beta Era Terrain ===
Xbox 360 edition was released with features roughly equivalent to Java Edition Beta 1.6, and therefore matched its terrain generation identically.


=== Early Release Era Terrain ===
Xbox 360 version TU5 released features identical to Java Edition Beta 1.8, and therefore, all seeds have changed. The addition of Jungle biomes in TU12 shuffled positions of all major land biomes, changing a decent portion of world seeds again on Xbox 360. All other console editions except for Nintento Switch edition were initially released with the latter world generation.


=== Major Release Era Terrain ===
Nintendo Switch edition was the only Legacy Console Edition to be initially released during this world generation's stage.
