The following page lists colors which are applied to items in the game.


== Both editions ==


=== Spawn eggs ===


=== Potions ===

IDs listed are that of the numerical effect IDs, not potion IDs.


=== Item forms of colored blocks ===
The inventory color of the grass is calculated with temperature:0.5 and rainfall:1.0. The result is AdjTemp:0.5, AdjRainfall:0.5, We can get the color( #7CBD6B) for the middle of center(x:127, y:127) of the grass.png.
These are exclusive to Java Edition; Bedrock Edition instead has pre-colored textures used for items, distinct from the textures actually used for blocks in placed form (see Bedrock Edition history of textures/Items).
