Mojang.com was Mojang Studios' official website, containing a blog and information hub about their games as well as merchandise produced by J!NX. The website served as an official outlet for updates regarding Minecraft until December 4, 2016, after which Minecraft.net was made the official source of Minecraft news. Since the announcement of the move to Minecraft.net, no further posts have been made to the site. All pages on Mojang.com now redirect to Minecraft.net.
Previously, the site was largely a placeholder, with a short biography and links to Notch's other game projects. Around the same time as the new Mojang logo was put in place, it was transformed into a full site to showcase the company. The site was run by Jeb, Carl and Kappische.
