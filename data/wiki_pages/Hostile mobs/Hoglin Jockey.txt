Hoglin jockeys are the rare appearance of a baby piglin riding a baby hoglin.


== Spawning ==


=== Post-generation ===
Baby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins. If there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.


=== Dismounting ===
The baby piglins can dismount the hoglin after getting on it, making Hoglin Jockeys a temporary occurrence.


== Drops ==
In Java Edition, a picked-up item always drops with the same durability as when picked up. In Bedrock Edition, armor picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break depending on how much damage the piglin takes. Piglins do not drop gold ingots, raw porkchops, or cooked porkchops that they have earlier picked up.


=== Experience ===
Adults drop 5 and an additional 1–3 per armor piece if killed by a player or tamed wolf. Baby piglins drop 1. Baby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins. They are also the only mobs that both grow up and also drop experience.


== Behavior ==


=== Baby piglins ===
Baby piglins are passive and play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.
Baby piglins can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away. Baby piglins can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons. However, they are unable to pick up leather.
Baby piglins never grow up.


=== Baby hoglins ===
Baby hoglins avoid warped fungi (including in a flower pot), nether portals and respawn anchors, and will run away from them when within 7 blocks of them. They naturally sink in water and eventually drown. They also sink in lava and are vulnerable to fire damage. Hoglins can be led with a lead despite the fact they are hostile. Baby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less damage and normal knockback. If the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.
