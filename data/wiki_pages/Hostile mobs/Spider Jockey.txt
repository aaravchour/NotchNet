Spider jockeys are the rare appearance of a spider or cave spider‌ being ridden by a skeleton, stray‌, or wither skeleton‌.


== Spawning ==


=== Spiders and skeletons ===
There is a 1% chance for a spider to spawn with a skeleton riding it, forming a spider jockey.
Spider jockeys spawned in narrow enclosures can cause the skeleton rider to die of suffocation, due to the spider scaling the walls. They can also spawn in a 1 high space with a transparent block above, so the skeleton is stuck in the transparent block.


=== Bedrock Edition ===
A cave spider can spawn as a jockey, just as a spider can.
If either type of spider is spawned in the Nether (spawned with a spawn egg, commands or monster spawners, since these do not naturally spawn there) and occurs as a jockey, it has an 80% chance for its skeleton rider to be a wither skeleton. If either type of spider is spawned in a snowy biome with a view of the sky, and occurs as a jockey, it has an 80% chance for its skeleton rider to be a stray.
Baby zombie variants can mount spiders and cave spiders. See zombie for details.


== Drops ==

The skeleton and the spider each have separate drops when that part of the spider jockey is killed.
Their drops are no different than if the skeleton or spider were standing alone.


== Behavior ==

The spider and the skeleton cannot attack each other.
The spider do not attack any entity in Java Edition. The movement of a spider jockey is controlled by the skeleton in Java Edition.


== Data values ==

A spider jockey spawns as two separate entities. The spider and skeleton's IDs nor the entity data are any different than if the skeleton or spider were standing alone.
