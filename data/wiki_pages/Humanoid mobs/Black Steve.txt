== Spawning ==

Black Steve spawned randomly in the world in at any light level as long as there was enough space.


== Behavior ==
Black Steve was a passive mob. It had no animation, so it glided aimlessly around the world in the same pose and occasionally jumped, although no jumping animation existed either. As a result, it would simply be raised off of the ground and then fall back down. 
Upon death, Black Steve would not fall over to the ground or flash red or white and appear to die, as most mobs do. It would just disappear shortly thereafter, and drop the items it was designated to drop.


== Drops ==
Upon death, Black Steve drops:

String (0–2) (most common)
Feather (0–2)
Gunpowder (0–2)
Flint and Steel (0–1) (extremely rare)

== Trivia ==
Black Steve, as well as all the other mobs made by Dock, Is meant to animate, but the game appears to just pick a random frame and doesn't animate any further. They just glide around in the same pose. However, the MD3 model itself contains a 22 frame animation of it walking.
Black Steve is the name of a character in 2007–08 television series Code Monkeys.
