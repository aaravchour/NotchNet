A vindicator is an illager equipped with an iron axe. Vindicators appear in woodland mansions and participate in raids. It sprints towards its targets to attack them with its axe.


== Spawning ==
On Normal difficulty and Hard difficulty, vindicators sometimes spawn with a randomly enchanted iron axe: the chance is 0–25%, and is higher when the regional difficulty is higher.


=== Woodland mansions ===
Vindicators spawn during the generation of woodland mansions, in groups of 1–3 inside particular rooms, sometimes accompanied by an evoker. Rarely, vindicators can spawn in the corridors and hallways. 
They do not respawn after initially spawning. Vindicators generated in mansions do not naturally despawn unless the world is switched to peaceful difficulty.‌
Vindicators are sometimes neutral if naturally spawned in a woodland mansion, which means that the vindicator does not attack the player on sight, but only after the player attacks it.


=== Patrols ===

In Java Edition, any vindicators can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain, but do not go seeking out for patrols to join.


=== Raids ===

Vindicators can spawn during raids. They appear more frequently during later waves and at higher difficulties.
Vindicators can spawn riding ravagers, creating a vindicator ravager jockey.‌


=== Java Edition ===
In Java Edition, if a player spawns a vindicator with a spawn egg or using a command, the vindicator has a chance of becoming an illager captain, with a Ominous banner attached above its back.


== Drops ==
A vindicator drops loot only when killed by a player or tamed wolf:

5 and an additional 1–3 per naturally-spawned equipment.
0–1 emeralds when killed by the player. The maximum increases by 1 for every level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.
8.5% chance of dropping their normal or enchanted iron axe, which increases by 1% per level of Looting with random durability.
1  Ominous banner(in Java Edition), or illager banner in Bedrock Edition if they spawn as a raid captain.
In Bedrock Edition, if a vindicator spawns as part of a raid, it drops:

0-1 Emerald
Additionally, in Bedrock Edition, vindicators have a 65% chance of dropping the following on Easy and Normal difficulties, and an 80% chance of dropping them on Hard difficulty:

0-1 Emerald (10⁄39 chance)
2-3 Emerald (5⁄39 chance)
4-5 Emerald (2⁄39 chance)
1 Enchanted Book (2⁄39 chance)
1 Iron Axe (5⁄78 chance)
1 Iron Pickaxe (5⁄78 chance)
1 Iron Shovel (5⁄78 chance)
1 Iron Sword (5⁄78 chance)
1 Iron Helmet (5⁄78 chance)
1 Iron Chestplate (5⁄78 chance)
1 Iron Leggings (5⁄78 chance)
1 Iron Boots (5⁄78 chance)
Notes:

Iron equipment from raid drops always has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment at level 5-19.
Iron equipment from raid drops is always damaged.
These drops are also affected by the Looting enchantment.
The enchanted book has a level 30 enchantment, may be treasure enchantment.
Emeralds are both a regular raid drop and an additional raid drop.
With Looting III enchantment, a vindicator has spawned from a raid can drop up to 16 emeralds upon death, but the chance is 3.328% on Easy or Normal, and 4.096% on Hard.
It is possible for a vindicator spawned from a raid to drop both its naturally-spawned iron axe and a second iron axe from its additional raid drops (in Easy and Normal difficulty 0.3536% chance, 0.3952% chance with Looting I, 0.4368% chance with Looting II, and 0.4784% chance with Looting III, while in Hard difficulty 0.4352% chance, 0.4864% chance with Looting I, 0.5376% chance with Looting II, and 0.5888% chance with Looting III).


== Appearance ==
Unlike most illagers, vindicators have gray skin, thick bushy eyebrows, blue eyes and wear a greyish-brown trench coat, a maroon red undershirt, blue jeans, and grey shoes.


== Behavior ==

Vindicators are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, wandering traders, and snow golems.‌ In Bedrock Edition, vindicators are passive to players on Peaceful difficulty but will still attack other mobs.
While idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed. While giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints. If it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.
On Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors. This is controlled by the raider tag. Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.
In Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate. All illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.
Unless named "Johnny", vindicators are the only illagers that do not cause mobs to retaliate against it.


=== Java Edition ===
Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs or players (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor. They do not call help from other kinds of illagers.
Vindicator raiders can break doors and open doors like villagers.
Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.


=== Bedrock Edition ===
Vindicators can only sprint, even when idle.
A dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.


=== Damage ===
Armed vindicators hit for 7.5 × 3.75 to 19.5 × 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty. They tie with piglin brutes for dealing the third most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 × 10.5 damage and the warden at 45 × 22.5 damage. 
The vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.


=== "Johnny" ===
A vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to every mob except evokers, pillagers, other vindicators, ghasts and players in Creative or Spectator mode. In Java Edition, they also do not attack baby villagers, illusioners or armor stands. This hostility extends to vexes, ravagers and witches in both editions.
"Johnny" vindicators will also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but it will not take damage.
All hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the "Johnny" vindicator in return, except for ender dragons, endermites (as they die in one hit), guardians, elder guardians, phantoms,  goats (apart from their usual ramming behavior), slimes, magma cubes, and ravagers.
Since raid captains can instruct nearby pillagers to attack their target, naming a vindicator raid captain "Johnny" will cause other raiders to attack Johnny's target, even if they wouldn't usually. This can cause witches, vexes and ravagers to target one another, and can even cause ravagers to attack themselves. If this causes a witch to target a ravager, the witch will instead throw Splash Potions of healing, since ravagers are raid mobs.
The Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described. Conversely, the player can name the vindicator "Johnny" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.
Naming a "Johnny" vindicator something else using a name tag will not set its Johnny tag to 0b, and it will continue to exhibit "Johnny" behavior.‌
Naming a vindicator spawn egg "Johnny" and using it on a spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named "Johnny".‌

Vindicators use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

== Trivia ==
The "Johnny" Easter egg is a reference to the movie The Shining, where a troubled man possessed by evil spirits in an isolated, haunted, labyrinthine, mansion-like hotel attacks his family with an axe, and says the iconic line "Here's Johnny!" while breaking a door down.
According to the Mobestiary, while a vindicator is stronger than a zombie, it still has low intelligence, 'a little smarter than a skeleton' (note that vindicators cannot use bows in-game).
Vindicators are the only illager that have blue eyes. Illusioners previously had blue eyes but in 1.14 (Java) they updated the Illusioner's model and changed their eye color to green.
Vindicators usually run away from the Creaking, however, if they are named "Johnny" with a name tag, the vindicators may at some point charge towards the creaking to attack but retaliate.
