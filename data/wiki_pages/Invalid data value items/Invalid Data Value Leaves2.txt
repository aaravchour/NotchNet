Invalid data value leaves2 refers to item forms of the secondary leaves block with damage values outside of the usual range which leaves can usually be obtained in.


== Obtaining ==
Without the use of commands, invalid data value leaves2 are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.
Only eight damage variants of the leaves2 block are currently known to be obtainable. Two of these correspond to existing species (0 for acacia and 1 for dark oak), with the other six being invalid data value variants. There is currently no known way to obtain leaves2 items with damage values of 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15. Like with all other invalid data value items documented on this wiki, there is also no known way to obtain items with damage values 16 and above, nor -1 and below.


=== Transmutation ===
Block transmutation with arrows can be used to obtain leaves2 blocks with metadata 2 and 3. These blocks can be mined with shears in 14w21b or earlier to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks. The initial block being transmuted must be acacia leaves from an existing tree which has not been updated, i.e. a leaves2 block with metadata value 0. Dark oak leaves, as well as player-placed acacia leaves or acacia leaves which have received a block update, cannot be transmuted. As such, an acacia tree must be grown in situ within a dedicated transmutation apparatus.


=== Breaking leaves2 blocks ===
From 14w25a to 14w28a, leaves2 blocks existing in the world will drop invalid data value leaves2 items when broken with shears. Acacia leaves will drop items with a damage value of 4, and dark oak leaves will drop items with a damage value of 5.
From 14w25a to 14w30b, breaking leaves2 blocks with a Silk Touch enchanted non-shears tool will drop different invalid data value leaves2 items: acacia leaves drop damage value 8, and dark oak leaves drop damage value 9.
Invalid data value leaves blocks that exist in the world cannot be broken in 14w25a or 14w25b, as approaching a chunk containing them will crash the game in these two versions. They cannot be broken in 14w26a or later, as such versions treat invalid blocks as air.


== Usage ==


=== Placement ===


=== Conversion to future versions ===
In 1.13 (17w47a) onwards, distinguishing between block and item variants using metadata and damage was formally abolished. As a result of this, existing items would be converted over to the new ID system automatically. Invalid data value leaves behave anomalously in that instead of converting to their respective parent species, they all convert to acacia leaves instead. Despite these items often being unknowingly collected and stored in older versions in such a way that conversion like this would end up being undesirable, Mojang have decided to not fix this.


== History ==

Inventory appearances (values marked in red are not known to be obtainable in survival mode)


== Issues ==
Invalid data value leaves2 are an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.
