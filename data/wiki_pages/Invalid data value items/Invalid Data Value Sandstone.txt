Invalid data value sandstone refers to item forms of sandstone with damage values outside of the usual range which sandstone can usually be obtained in.


== Obtaining ==
Without the use of commands, invalid data value sandstone items are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.


=== Transmutation ===
Several methods of block transmutation can be used to obtain invalid data value sandstone in block form. These blocks can be mined from 1.2.4 to 14w21b to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.
For arrow transmutation, the initial block being transmuted must be a regular sandstone block, i.e. a sandstone block with metadata value 0. Cut or chiseled sandstone cannot be transmuted.
