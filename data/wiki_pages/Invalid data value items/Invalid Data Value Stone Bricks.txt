Invalid data value stone bricks refers to item forms of stone bricks with damage values outside of the usual range which stone bricks can usually be obtained in.


== Obtaining ==
Without the use of commands, invalid data value stone bricks items are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.


=== Transmutation ===
Several methods of block transmutation can be used to obtain invalid data value stone bricks in block form. These blocks can be mined from Beta 1.8 Pre-release to 14w21b to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.
For arrow transmutation, the initial block being transmuted must be a regular stone bricks block, i.e. a stone bricks block with metadata value 0. Cracked, mossy or or chiseled stone bricks cannot be transmuted.
