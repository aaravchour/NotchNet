A beetroot is a food and dye ingredient.


== Obtaining ==


=== Farming ===
Beetroots are obtained from harvesting a fully grown crop block, which drops 1 beetroot and 1-4 seeds (2 5⁄7 seeds per plant harvested on average). Seed yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3⁄7 seeds per plant.
These crops can be found growing in villages or can be grown from planted beetroot seeds.


== Usage ==


=== Food ===
A beetroot can be eaten to restore 1 () hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation. Six beetroots can be crafted into beetroot soup, which restores six times the hunger and saturation of a single beetroot.


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Breeding ===
Beetroots can be used to breed pigs. Pigs also follow a player who is holding beetroot.
Villagers can pick up beetroot items to become willing, allowing them to breed. Villagers need 12 beetroots before they can breed.


=== Composting ===
Placing beetroot into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.


=== Trading ===
Novice-level Farmer villagers have a 25%‌ or 40%‌ chance to buy 15 beetroots for an emerald.
