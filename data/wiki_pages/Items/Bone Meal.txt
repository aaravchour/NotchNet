==== Wasting bone meal ====
Bone meal can be used on the following objects in the following situations, consuming it without any real effect:

On grass, ferns, and seagrass that do not have enough space to grow.
On seagrass that doesn't have water above.
On a dark oak sapling that is not in a group of four.
On a mushroom that is not on a block that allows it to grow into a huge mushroom.
On a sea pickle that is already in a group of four and has no valid locations to expand to.
On a bamboo (not bamboo shoot) that is blocked in the way.
On a sea pickle that is not on a coral block.
On a fungus that is not on its respective nylium.
Any plants that can't grow due to being block by the build limit.


=== Creating new plants ===
If bone meal is used on a grass block; tall grass, grass, flowers, and pink petals form on the targeted block and on random adjacent grass blocks in an 15×5×15‌/7×5×7‌ area centered on the targeted block. The flowers/pink petals that appear depend on the biome, meaning that in order to obtain specific flowers, the player must travel to biomes where the flowers are found naturally. See Flower § Flower biomes for more information.
Using bone meal on a 2-block flower (rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs or peonies) will cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original. This is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks.
Using bone meal on a non-transparent block that is underwater generates seagrass on that block and surrounding blocks. Sometimes, if in a warm ocean biome, coral and coral fans may have a chance to generate as well, and in Bedrock Edition, coral (not coral fan) can be generated in any biome. In order for this to work, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water.
Using bone meal on a sea pickle on a coral block creates sea pickles. This generates sea pickles up to 3 blocks (of coral) away, so a 7+ × 7+ block (49+ blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks).
Using bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type. If both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created.
Using bone meal on nylium causes the corresponding roots and both types of fungi to appear on the nylium block and other nylium nearby, with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common. In addition, using bone meal on the side of warped nylium creates nether sprouts and twisting vines.


=== Farmer villagers ===

== Trivia ==
Bone meal can be used on the sides or bottom of a grass block, as well as on a grass block with plants already on top of it.
Regardless of if it succeeds in fertilizing, bone meal makes green sparkles. However, like smoke from a torch, the sparkles appear only if the player has particles set All or Decreased.
In real life, bone meal is used as a fertilizer to provide nitrogen and phosphorus to plants.
