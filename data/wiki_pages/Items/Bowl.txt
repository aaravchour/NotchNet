Bowls are containers that can hold certain foods.


== Obtaining ==


=== Crafting ===


=== Fishing ===
Bowls can be obtained as a "junk" item while fishing.


=== Eating ===
A bowl containing food becomes an empty bowl when the food is eaten. 


=== Mob loot ===
When a turtle is killed by a lightning bolt, it drops 1 bowl.


== Usage ==


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Mooshrooms ===
Using a bowl on a mooshroom turns the bowl into mushroom stew or suspicious stew. The stew can then be consumed immediately and the process repeated, making this an excellent way to quickly restore depleted hunger and saturation with almost no cost or effort.


=== Fuel ===
Bowls can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per bowl in Java Edition, and 1 item per bowl in Bedrock Edition.

== Trivia ==
in Bedrock Edition, bowls are actually more fuel efficient than sticks. If 6 wood planks are crafted into 8 bowls, 8 items can be smelted; but if those are crafted into 12 sticks, only 6 items can be smelted. This can be useful when the player only has access to Nether wood types, which cannot be used as fuel.
