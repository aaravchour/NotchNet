Charcoal is an item obtained by smelting logs or wood. It is used as fuel, or for crafting torches and campfires. Unlike coal, charcoal cannot be traded with villagers, nor can it be crafted into a block of coal. Coal and charcoal cannot stack together either. It can be used as a substitute for coal, as both charcoal and coal have an equivalent duration when smelted.

=== Fuel ===
When used in a furnace as a fuel, a piece of charcoal lasts 80 seconds (smelting up to 8 items), the same as coal. Charcoal used as fuel lasts more than 5 times longer than wood planks or wood logs used as fuel, being more efficient than any other use of wood for smelting in Java Edition, but outstripped by wooden slabs in Bedrock. 
Coal and charcoal are also the only fuels accepted by furnace minecarts. They provide approximately four minutes of transit each.
