== Trivia ==
In A Minecraft Movie, Lava Chicken is a similar variant to cooked chicken, however it involves dumping Lava on Chickens. This technique is clearly seen in the film, where Steve (enacted by Jack Black) pulls down a lever, which drops a chicken in a lava chamber.
This technique is possible in-game, and could be a reference to automated chicken farms in game, where dispensers with lava are used to burn a chicken and take back the lava as it dies.
How this machine would work is chickens are stored on top, redstone staircases up and activates both a trapdoor and a dispenser, lava falls on the chicken, and steve sings the song, however in game this cooking process would be instantaneous. Seeing as the lava is not removed as the cooked chicken comes out, there must be a slab with hopper under. Then a hopper pipe transports it into a dropper, which drops it on a oak plank,then the garbage man eats it.
When a player eats a Lava Chicken, flame or smoke comes out of the mouth or nose. This doesn't happen in game.
The "Lava Chicken" song became a popular hit, when the film came out in the theaters. Because of this, Mojang added the Lava Chicken Music Disc, a remix of the original song by HyperPotions.
