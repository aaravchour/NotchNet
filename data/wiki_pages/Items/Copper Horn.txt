A copper horn was an item crafted from a goat horn and copper ingots.

=== Natural generation ===
Copper horns were found in pillager outpost chests.


== Usage ==
Copper horns were used to play sounds. They took one second to use and had a four second cooldown. There were ten variations of copper horns, and each of them played three different sounds: when looking up, crouching, or neither of those. In total, there were thirty different sounds that could be played using copper horns. The sound a copper horn plays based on multiple conditions, which are in order as follows:

If crouching, the bass tune was played.
Else, if looking up (by 45 degrees), the harmony tune was played.
Else, the melody tune was played.


== Sounds ==
Sound names in the item tooltip are created using the harmony, melody, and bass sounds in that order.

== Trivia ==
Copper horns were removed from the game as they didn't live up to the developers' design goals, and as such are no longer supported.
This is the first item in Bedrock Edition to have been completely removed instead of just made unobtainable. This is likely due to the fact it never made it out of experimental gameplay.
If a world that contained this item is loaded into a newer version, the horn will disappear upon loading.
