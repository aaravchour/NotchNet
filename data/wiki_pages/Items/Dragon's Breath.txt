The dragon's breath is a brewing item that is used solely to make lingering potions.


== Obtaining ==
The dragon's breath can be obtained by scooping  up the ender dragon's breath attack or the purple effect clouds caused by dragon fireballs in an empty glass bottle.


== Usage ==


=== Brewing ingredient ===
Dragon's breath may be added to any splash potion to upgrade it to a lingering potion, which can be used to create a lasting area effect cloud, or to craft tipped arrows.

When put 2 or more dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, a glass bottle will drop as an entity. However, if put only 1 dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, the glass bottle is consumed and cannot be retrieved.

== Trivia ==
If the dragon's breath is used in a crafting recipe (using a mod or a data pack), it becomes an empty bottle instead of being entirely consumed.
The advancement you get from collecting dragon breath is called “You Need a Mint,” a stock phrase used to complain about halitosis.
