An egg is an item that can be used to craft food items, or thrown for a chance to spawn chicks on impact.


== Obtaining ==


=== Mob loot ===

A chicken drops an egg item every 5–10 minutes. The theoretical average would be expected at 1 egg every 7.5 minutes, or 0.1333 eggs per minute.
A fox sometimes spawns holding an egg, which it always drops upon death. Alternatively, a player dropping a food item causes the fox to drop the egg.

== Usage ==


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Combat ===
Players are able to throw eggs and deal knockback to mobs (but not other players‌‌), but no damage is dealt, similar to a snowball. Likewise, throwing eggs at neutral mobs provokes them. Eggs can also be fired from dispensers and are affected by gravity.


=== Spawning chickens ===
When thrown by a dispenser or by pressing the use button, an egg has a 1⁄8 (12.5%) chance of spawning a chick. If this occurs, there is a 1⁄32 (3.125%) chance of spawning three additional chicks (on average, 1 out of every 256 eggs spawns 4 chicks). In other words, whenever an egg is thrown, there is a 31⁄256 chance of spawning 1 chick and a 1⁄256 chance of spawning four chicks.
The expected value of the number of chicks an egg produces is 35⁄256 or 13.7%. This means that on average, a chick is spawned every 7.3 eggs, a stack of 16 eggs spawns 2.188 chicks, and a full inventory including the hotbar and off-hand (37 * 16 = 592 eggs) is expected to spawn approximately 81 chicks.

== Trivia ==
Eggs break mid-fall if hit by another projectile; the chance of spawning a chick is not affected.
Throwing an egg at a nether portal breaks the egg when it hits the portal.
A thrown egg faces toward the player in first-person view, while it appears rotated horizontally in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable items (ender pearls, eggs, snowballs, and all throwable potions).
