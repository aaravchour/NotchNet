An ender pearl is an item that can be thrown and teleports the thrower to where it lands, and used to craft eyes of ender which are required to access the End.


== Obtaining ==


=== Mob loot ===
An enderman has a 50% chance to drop 1 ender pearl when killed. The drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, with a maximum of 4 with Looting III.


=== Chest loot ===

A trapped chest always containing 2 ender pearls can be found in the "fake end portal" room of woodland mansions.


=== Trading ===
In Java Edition, expert-level cleric villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to sell an ender pearl for 5 emeralds.
In Bedrock Edition, expert-level cleric villagers sell one ender pearl for 5 emeralds.


=== Bartering ===
Piglins have a 10⁄459 (4.27) chance to barter 3-4 ender pearls when given a gold ingot.


== Usage ==
Ender pearls can be thrown by pressing use. After it is thrown, the ender pearl is consumed, and the player teleports to where it lands, taking 5 fall damage. Wearing armor enchanted with Protection and/or Feather Falling reduces the damage taken from the ender pearl. 
Ender pearls have a small cone of travel; they do not all follow the same path when thrown in the same direction. The direction and velocity of ender pearl throws is slightly randomized. They can travel about 30 blocks when thrown straight up, and up to 54 blocks forward when thrown at an optimum launch angle of ~35° (on even ground).
The thrower's vertical velocity influences the throw. Hence timing a throw with a jump can increase the throwing range to 42 blocks when thrown straight up and 64 blocks forward at a 35° angle. Throwing while falling significantly decreases the range. Ender pearls collide with all minecart types, boats, end crystals and nether portals, and travel through end portals. Ender pearls that fall into the void disappear, and do not trigger the player to teleport. However, ender pearl entities (instead of dropped items) are not destroyed by lava and will teleport the player to the bottom of lava pools/lava oceans.
Ender pearls have a cooldown of one second before they can be used again. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay on the ender pearl that shrinks and must disappear before the player can use it again. If there are other inventory or hotbar slots containing ender pearls, they are covered with the white overlay as well. 
Ender pearls can be thrown into end gateways to reach the outer islands of the End. They can also be thrown into the exit portal to reach the player's spawn point.
Ender pearl teleportation makes no sound itself‌, but does emit a "small fall" sound at the destination when applying teleportation damage to the player.


=== Stasis chamber ===
Ender pearls are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a trapdoor), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.


=== Spawning endermites ===
An ender pearl has a 10% chance to spawn an endermite when it lands. This is the only way through which endermites can spawn, without using cheats. The endermite spawns at the player's position when the pearl lands‌, or at the pearl's landing site‌.

== Trivia ==
Ender pearls can be used to teleport/move through non-solid blocks without suffocation and solid blocks by pressing against the blocks and using the ender pearl at the player's feet until the player goes through.
In Java Edition, it is possible to spawn a thrown ender pearl using commands, but it does not teleport, unless it is assigned an owner.
If the player throws an ender pearl and then dies before impact while the pearl is in a loaded chunk, the pearl disappears and the player is not teleported. Pearls in unloaded chunks do not disappear if their owner dies.‌
If the player throws an ender pearl in Survival mode and changes to Creative mode before the pearl lands, the player is still teleported.
The player is still teleported by throwing an ender pearl and entering the Nether before it lands. The pearl is not lost if an ender pearl is thrown into a nether portal and the player travels through the portal; the pearl lands and teleports the player as usual.
If multiple ender pearls are thrown in succession, the player can be hurt only once from fall damage within about a one-second span.
If a player dies from ender pearl teleportation, the death message says: "<player> hit the ground too hard".
A thrown ender pearl faces toward the player in first-person view, while it appears rotated horizontal in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable items (ender pearl, egg, snowball, and all throwable potions).
Ender pearls and snowballs have the exact same range when fired. Therefore, snowballs can be used to predict the trajectory of ender pearls, or simply for practicing ender pearl throwing. This can be very helpful when the player has to throw ender pearls in dangerous environments, such as the Nether or the End.
Despite the fact that ender pearls deal no damage to anything they're thrown at, provokable mobs (such as iron golems and piglins) will be provoked by the player if one is thrown at them.
