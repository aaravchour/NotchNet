Flint is a mineral obtained from gravel.


== Obtaining ==


=== Mining ===
When a block of gravel is mined, there is a 10% chance for a single piece of flint to drop instead of the gravel block. When mined with a Fortune-enchanted tool, this chance increases to 16% at Fortune I, 25% at Fortune II, and 100% at Fortune III. Gravel mined using a tool with Silk Touch or gravel that fell on a non-solid block never produces flint.


=== Trading ===
Novice-level fletcher villagers have a 50%‌ or 2⁄3‌ chance to offer 10 pieces of flint for 10 blocks of gravel and an emerald.
