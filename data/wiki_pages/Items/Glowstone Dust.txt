=== Mining ===
When broken using anything other than a Silk Touch-enchanted tool, a glowstone block drops 2-4 glowstone dust. A Fortune enchantment increases the chances of higher drops, with Fortune III allowing an average yield of 3.5 glowstone dust per block.

Witches have a chance of dropping 0–6 glowstone dust upon death. This is increased by 3 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-15 glowstone dust.
