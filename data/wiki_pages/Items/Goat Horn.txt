A goat horn is an item dropped by goats. It has eight variants, and each plays a unique sound when used which can be heard by players in a large radius.


== Obtaining ==


=== Mob loot ===
A goat horn is dropped when an adult goat rams a tree or any other hard block that occurs naturally where goats spawn. These include stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, log, or packed ice. Goats do not ram other solid blocks. In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the snaps_goat_horn tag, and can be modified by data packs.
Up to two goat horns can be dropped from an adult goat. Regular goats drop the Ponder, Sing, Seek, and Feel goat horns, while screaming goats drop the Admire, Call, Yearn, and Dream goat horns. A specific goat drops only one type of goat horn; that is, if a goat drops a Sing horn, its other horn is also a Sing horn.


=== Natural generation ===

Only the four variants from regular goats can be found here.


== Usage ==
When used, goat horns play a loud sound that can be heard from up to 256 blocks, but are also limited by the server view distance. Each goat horn variant plays a unique sound. There are eight variants, four of which are exclusively dropped by screaming goats.
There is a cooldown of seven seconds between each use of the goat horn. All goat horns are affected by this cooldown.
