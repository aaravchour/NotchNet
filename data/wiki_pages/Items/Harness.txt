A harness is an item used on happy ghasts to ride on and comes with 16 colored variants. It was revealed in Minecraft Live - March 2025 and added in the Chase the Skies Game Drop.


== Obtaining ==


=== Crafting ===

A harness also drops as an item when unequipping it from a happy ghast using shears.


== Usage ==

Happy Ghasts can only be ridden up to 4 players when equipped with a harness. Using a harness on happy ghast equips it, and harnesses can also be equipped using a dispenser block. Using shears on a happy ghast that is wearing a harness unequips it, and drops it as an item.
Happy Ghasts also follow players holding a harness if they don't have one equipped yet.
Harnesses feature large vintage-style aviator goggles, which lowers and covers the happy ghast's eyes when it is being ridden by a player.
