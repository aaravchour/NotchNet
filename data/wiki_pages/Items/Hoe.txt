A hoe is a tool used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly, as well as to till most types of dirt into farmland and convert coarse dirt and rooted dirt to regular dirt.


== Obtaining ==


=== Crafting ===


=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a diamond hoe can be upgraded to a netherite hoe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed.


=== Repairing ===


==== Grinding ====


==== Unit repair ====

A hoe can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material (or the same hoe of that tier), with each repair material restoring 25% of the hoe's maximum durability, rounded down. It also keeps the hoe's enchantments.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Trading ===
Novice-level toolsmith villagers have a chance to sell a stone hoe for one emerald, and journeyman-level toolsmiths have a chance to sell a diamond hoe for 4 emeralds. In Bedrock Edition, these are 25% chances, and in Java Edition, these are 40% chances.


=== Villager gifts ===
Toolsmith villagers occasionally throw stone hoes at players with the Hero of the Village status effect.‌


== Usage ==


=== Harvesting ===
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 durability.

Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.


=== Tilling ===
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into farmland. To till, press use on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on mycelium or podzol, nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.
Hoes can be used to convert coarse dirt into regular dirt by pressing use on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.
Hoes can also be used on rooted dirt, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item.
Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.
Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.


=== Weapon ===
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only 1 damage in Java Edition. In Bedrock Edition, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 2 durability when used as a weapon.
In Java Edition, hoes have an attack speed modifier depending on the material: wood and gold have a modifier of -3 (refill in 1s), stone has a modifier of -2 (refill in 0.5s), iron has a modifier of -1 (refill in 0.33s), and diamond and netherite have a modifier of 0 (refill in 0.25s).

Hoes always attack instantly in Bedrock Edition.


=== Enchantments ===
A hoe can receive the following enchantments and curses:


=== Fuel ===
Wooden hoes can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1 item per hoe.


=== Smelting ingredient ===


=== Piglins ===
Piglins are attracted to golden hoes and run toward any golden hoes on the ground, and inspect them for 6 to 8 seconds before putting them in their inventory.

Issues relating to "Hoe" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.


== Trivia ==
Tilling a dirt block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to farmland even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a block horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
When a hoe breaks, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.
The textures for the post 1.14 iron and stone hoes have an error, where the color for the edge of the handle is partly the same color as the edge of the top part.  This isn't present in any other tool.
