Iron ingots are versatile metal ingots used extensively in crafting.


== Obtaining ==


=== Chest loot ===


=== Crafting ===


=== Smelting ===
Smelting raw iron in a furnace or blast furnace is the most common way to obtain iron ingots.


=== Compound creation ===
Iron Ingot can be created from its base elements, using the compound creator.‌


=== Mob loot ===

Iron golems drop 3-5 iron ingots upon death, regardless of the way they die. The looting enchantment does not increase the amount of iron ingots dropped.
Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1⁄40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1⁄100) per level of looting. This gives iron ingots the following chances of dropping:

1⁄120 (about 0.83%)
7⁄600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I
9⁄600 (1.50%) with Looting II
11⁄600 (about 1.83%) with Looting III


== Usage ==

=== Trading ===
Apprentice-level Armorer, Toolsmith, and Weaponsmith villagers buy 3 iron ingots for an emerald as their third trade.‌
Apprentice-level Armorer villagers have a 50% chance to buy 4 iron ingots for one emerald, and apprentice-level Toolsmith and Weaponsmith villagers always offer to buy 4 iron ingots for one emerald.‌
