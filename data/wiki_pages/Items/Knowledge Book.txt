A knowledge book is a utility item that reveals available crafting recipes to the player when used.


== Obtaining ==
Knowledge books can be obtained only by using commands, as it is not found in the creative inventory; therefore, it is impossible to obtain in other modes such as survival and adventure except with commands.
For example, to give oneself a knowledge book that reveals the recipes for buckets and flower pots, use: /[[Commands/'"`uniq--nowiki-00000001-qinu`"'|'"`uniq--nowiki-00000001-qinu`"']].


== Usage ==
Knowledge books are used to reveal recipes to the player who uses it, by adding it to their recipe book. Using a knowledge book consumes it, removing it from the player's inventory.
Knowledge books are especially useful to mapmakers in conjunction with /gamerule doLimitedCrafting true, because then any item is craftable only if its recipe is unlocked first.
