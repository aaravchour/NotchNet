A minecart with command block is an impulse‌ or repeating‌ command block inside a minecart.


== Obtaining ==
The minecart with command block is obtainable only using the command /give @s command_block_minecart, as it does not appear in the creative inventory‌ and has no crafting recipe. It can also be summoned using the command /summon command_block_minecart. It can be broken like any other minecart, but only the minecart is retained, while the command block is lost.


== Usage ==

The minecart with command block combines the functionalities of both minecarts and command blocks. Although the minecart visually contains an impulse command block, it functions more similarly to a repeating command block, and runs its command once every four game ticks when on an active activator rail. When it passes over a detector rail with a comparator connected next to it, it outputs the command block's result.


== Sounds ==

Minecarts with command blocks use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.
