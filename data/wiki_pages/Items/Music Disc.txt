Music discs are a set of 21 musical records that can be played in jukeboxes.


== Obtaining ==


=== Crafting ===
Disc 5 is the only disc that can be crafted, unlike all other discs. This disc can be crafted with its fragments.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Archaeology ===


=== Mob loot ===
When killed by any skeleton or stray (or wither skeleton if given a bow using commands), a creeper drops a random music disc in addition to its normal drops, with the exceptions of Pigstep, otherside, 5, Relic, Creator, Creator (Music Box), Precipice and Lava Chicken.
Because TNT ignited by a flaming arrow attributes all resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow, a skeleton igniting a TNT block due to holding a bow enchanted with Flame, or shooting through lava or fire, also causes any creepers killed in the explosion to drop a disc.
Ghasts drop the music disc "Tears" upon death by a player deflected fire charge.
Killing a zombie Chicken Jockey drops the "Lava Chicken" music disc. However, it doesn't drop from killing baby Zombified Piglin, baby Husk, baby Zombie Villager or baby Drowned riders. Killing the chicken before attacking the baby zombie doesn't drop the disc too.


=== Trial Chambers ===
There are three loot locations in order to obtain the three new music discs.
Creator (Music Box) can be found in Decorated Pots. Precipice can be found via unlocking Trial Vaults. Creator can be found via unlocking Ominous Vaults.

== Appearance ==
Music discs resemble older 78-rpm phonograph records from the early 20th century, which were often played in jukeboxes from that era.
Although most of C418's music discs and Lena Raine's "otherside" are gray with small multicolored centers, "Disc 11" is a broken disc, with cracks and small chunks poking out. "Disc 5", however, features a bioluminescent blue outer ring, reminiscent of sculk blocks.
"Pigstep" is a red netherrack disc with a gold indentation centre. "Relic" is a brick red disc with a pale sky blue indentation centre.
Both "Creator" and "Creator (Music Box)" music discs appear to be made of copper, with small gold indentation centres, whereas "Precipice" seems to be made of tuff, featuring a ring of copper (different oxidation stages of copper are visible on the disc).
The "Tears" music disc is a contrasting white which is slightly reminiscent of ghast tears.
The “Lava Chicken” music disc features a design that combines red and white, with the red color dominating the sides and the white color occupying the centre.


== Usage ==
Music discs can be played on a jukebox by holding the disc and right-clicking on the jukebox.
The in-game music disc tracks are all monaural recordings. Tracks released for listening outside of the game are in stereo.
If the player places a comparator besides a jukebox, the intensity of the redstone signal depends on the disc currently played, with the following values:

== Issues ==
Issues relating to "Music Disc" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.


== Trivia ==
Before The Flattening, data values used by music discs ranged from 2256 to 2267, while all other blocks/items used the first free data value available.
The title "13" is a reference to the 13 cave ambience sounds that existed when the disc was added. Similar sounds can be heard throughout the track.
Because "13" was created in 2010, it actually uses older sound effects from earlier versions of the game for bow firing, arrow impacts, explosions, and water splashing, which have since been replaced.
The background noise also bears resemblance to a deeper version of the unused and removed cave chimes. Before the explosion, there was also the sound of a creeper fuse which is still used.
C418 initially wanted the music disc to be found deep underground in a cave in-game, being played by some device.
Exclusively on Legacy Console Edition, an extra track called "dog" is appended to the "cat" music disc. Once "cat" is done playing and fades out, "dog" begins playing for another two minutes or so, making this version of "cat" the longest music disc in the game.
On pre-made maps (Tutorial Worlds and Map Packs) of the Legacy Console Edition, there was a Music Disc Hunt on which you had to find 12 music discs hidden in chests throughout the worlds.
"chirp" uses the same accompaniment samples as "The Orb of Dreamers" from the LittleBigPlanet series. The samples come from the Optigan disc "Bossa Nova Style". C418 stated that it was coincidental.
The texture used for the music disc "chirp" was previously used for the camera tripod texture prior to Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha.
The title "stal" is a Swedish word meaning stole in English and a Polish word meaning steel.
The music disc "11" is the only visibly damaged music disc.
If the .ogg file for "11" is turned into a spectrogram in an audio editor, the static at the end displays what seems to be Steve's face and the numbers 12418. The numbers are a visual signature, where "C" is hexadecimal for "12", and combined with "418" creates "C418", the name of the producer of all of the music disc tracks except for "Pigstep", "otherside", "5" and "Relic".
Within the disc are sounds, in order of appearance, of stone and dirt or gravel. At the time disc "11" was made, footstep sounds, placing sounds, and breaking sounds were the same for the respecive block. It is unknown exactly what the character was doing when these sounds were played.
There is a track that is exclusive to the album Minecraft - Volume Beta called "Eleven", which has the same length of 1:11 and begins with the same vinyl static sound before being abruptly interrupted by a record scratching sound and switching to a new, calm piano piece.
C418 once imagined that the "monster" chasing the person in "11" is himself "being a weird monster that occasionally records songs from strangers and then dies in '11'".
"11" causes jukeboxes to output a redstone signal strength of 11.
Before Java Edition 1.13, the data value of "11" was 11.
Brandon Pearce stated that the warden mob is based on the "monster" heard at the end of "11".
The music disc "wait", originally titled "where are we now", was finally added to Java Edition 1.4.3 after existing solely in the game's files for an unspecified amount of time.
"wait" used the original title "where are we now" in older versions of the Legacy Console Edition.
"Pigstep" is the only disc to have its name capitalized in-game, and it can only be found in bastion remnants. It is also the music disc with the fastest beat.
"Pigstep" is a portmanteau of "piglin" and "dubstep".
“5” is the only music disc that is crafted, as it requires 9 disc fragments in a 3×3 formation to craft.
Playing "5", "11", and "13" at 5, 11, and 13 seconds respectively, creates a cohesive melody
In disc “5”, there are some sounds taken from Minecraft Dungeons of the Endersent , the Vengeful Heart of Ender, and relating to an enderman .
Other sounds can be heard. In order of appearance, these are: flint and steel clicking , a bat, lava bubbling, amethyst cluster breaking, a sculk shrieker, stone, sand, a sculk shrieker overlaying a warden, sculk sensor clicking, and a warden roaring.
The new 1.21.7 disc "Lava Chicken" is a remix of "Steve's Lava Chicken" song from A Minecraft Movie. The original song is sung by Jack Black, who played the role of Steve.
In most of the music segments, a Villager is heard singing.
