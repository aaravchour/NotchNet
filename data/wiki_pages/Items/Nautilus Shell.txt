A nautilus shell is an item that is used for crafting conduits.


== Obtaining ==


=== Fishing ===

Nautilus shells can be rarely obtained as a treasure item from fishing. The drop chances of nautilus shells slightly increase with each level of Luck of the Sea on the player's fishing rod.


=== Mob loot ===
Drowned have a 3%‌ or 8%‌ chance to spawn with a nautilus shell in their off-hand, and this nautilus shell always drops upon death.


=== Trading ===
Wandering traders may sell a nautilus shell for 5 emeralds each, but they only sell 5 of them at a time.


== Usage ==
In Bedrock Edition, a nautilus shell is one of the few items that can be held in the off-hand.


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Trading ===
Nautilus shells can be given to trident-wielding drowned with a chance for the drowned to pick up the shell and drop the trident.[Bedrock Edition only] This feature was actually mentioned as a bug and will soon be fixed in Bedrock Edition 1.21.120

== Trivia ==
Nautiluses are animals that occupy deep oceans in the real world. However, they will appear to Minecraft in an upcoming game drop as a mob.
Because Bedrock Edition allows for Nautilus shells to be held in the off-hand (since drowned hold them), they are the only item in that version that can be put in the off-hand slot without having a specific function.
