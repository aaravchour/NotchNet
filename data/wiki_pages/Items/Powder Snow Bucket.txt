A powder snow bucket is a bucket with powder snow inside.


== Obtaining ==
A powder snow bucket can be obtained by using an empty bucket on a powder snow block or powder snow cauldron.


== Usage ==
Pressing use while holding a powder snow bucket places a powder snow block. In Java Edition, powder snow may also be placed inside empty cauldrons, creating powder snow cauldrons.
Dispensers can also create and place powder snow buckets. However, they cannot do so with cauldrons. You can also use it to cushion falls in the nether by placing it below you when falling.
