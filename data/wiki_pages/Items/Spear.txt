=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a diamond spear can be upgraded to a netherite spear via a netherite upgrade, although increased durability and resistance to fire/lava in item form are the only benefits. The spear's performance as a melee weapon is unchanged by the upgrade.

== Usage ==


=== Charging ===
To perform a charge attack, the player must hold down the use key. The spear will be lowered to an attack position. The spear will launch to a targeting entity when released. The amount of damage dealt to the target is depends on the velocity of the user.
As it holds for too long, it begins to shake. As it holds even longer, it goes to a dropped down state, which no longer deal knockback, but deals a full damage to an entity.


=== Jabbing ===
To perform a jab attack, the player can use while standing on the ground, dealing damage to an entity when hit, depending on the tier.


=== Piglins ===
Piglins are attracted to golden spears and run toward any golden spears on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.
