A spear is a weapon that was added in the Mounts of Mayhem update in 2025, December 6th. It consists of two attack types: charging and jabbing. It was revealed in Minecraft Live - September 2025.

=== Crafting ===


=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a diamond spear can be upgraded to a netherite spear via a netherite upgrade, although increased durability and resistance to fire/lava in item form are the only benefits. The spear's performance as a melee weapon is unchanged by the upgrade.

=== Mob Loot ===
Zombies, husks, zombie horsemen and camel husk jockey riders naturally spawn wielding iron spears. Piglins and zombified piglins naturally spawn wielding golden spears.


=== Generated Loot ===
Stone spears can be found in ocean ruins, copper spears can be found in the weaponsmith's houses, and iron spears can be found in both the weaponsmith's house and treasure chests.
Diamond spears can be exclusively found in bastion remnants, end cities and obtained from vaults.


== Usage ==


=== Charging ===
To perform a charge attack, the player must hold down the use key. The spear will be lowered to an attack position, and when released, it will launch to a targeting entity. The amount of damage dealt to the target depends on the velocity of the user.
If the user holds the spear for too long, it begins to shake. If the player charges it even longer, it drops down lower, which no longer knocks back an entity, but deals full damage to it. It will then be drawn back to to the holding position.


=== Jabbing ===
To perform a jab attack, the player can use it while standing on the ground, dealing damage to an entity when hit, depending on the tier.


=== Piglins ===
Piglins are attracted to golden spears and run toward any golden spears on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.


=== Enchantments ===
Spears can be enchanted with Lunge (levels 1 to 3) that allows players to jab more damage to an entity while swiftly moving past it. However, the number of times the player uses it, their hunger bar drains out, depending on the level of enchantment.
