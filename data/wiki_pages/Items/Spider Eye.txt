==== Spiders ====
Spiders and cave spiders have a 1⁄3 chance of dropping a spider eye when killed by a player or tamed wolf, but not when killed by environmental damage (such as falling). The maximum amount of spider eyes is increased by 1 per level of Looting. The chance of a spider not dropping any spider eyes can be found using the formula 2 / (Looting Level + 3). For example, Looting III gives a 1⁄3 chance of not dropping any spider eyes. All other amounts have an equal chance of occurring.


==== Witches ====
Witches have a chance of dropping 0–6 spider eyes upon death. This is increased by 3 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-15 spider eyes.

== Usage ==


=== Food ===
When eaten, a spider eye restores 2 () hunger points and 3.2 saturation points, giving a nourishment value of 1.6. It also applies a Poison effect lasting 5 seconds to the player, causing 4 damage, which reduces hunger/saturation by 6 points.


=== Breeding ===
Spider eyes can be used to breed armadillos and reduce the remaining growth duration of baby armadillos by 10%. Armadillos also follow a player holding spider eyes.
