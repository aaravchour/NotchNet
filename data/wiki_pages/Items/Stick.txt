== Trivia ==
The stick is used in 49 recipes in Java Edition, and 50 recipes in Bedrock Edition, more than any other item in the game. Iron ingot takes second place with 35 recipes, and planks take third place with 34 recipes.
To craft each recipe once, a player would need 111 sticks, including 1 for the redstone torch in an activator rail, while using the extra tripwire hook for the crossbow. This would require 56 planks, or 14 logs, for the sticks, and an extra 29 planks for the wooden tools, tripwire hook, signs, fences, fence gate, grindstone, and slabs for the barrel. This means that the player needs a total of 85 planks, or 22 logs, plus 6 more for the campfire and soul campfire.
