The sword is a melee weapon utilized to inflict damage to entities and to break a few blocks, such as cobwebs and bamboo, faster. A sword is made from one stick and two items of six materials, in order of increasing quality and expense: wood, gold, stone, iron, copper, diamond. Netherite Item creation is explained in Upgrading.


== Obtaining ==


=== Crafting ===
Most swords, with the exception of the netherite sword, can be crafted with a stick and two of the tier's material. Crafting them is the simplest way to get a sword.


=== Upgrading ===
Diamond swords can be upgraded to netherite swords to increse their attack damages, item durabilities and to grant the immunity to fire and lava when they are dropped. A player can utilize a smithing table to their diamond sword using the this sword, a netherite upgrade item and a netherite ingot.

=== Repairing ===


==== Combining ====


==== Grinding ====


==== Anvil unit repair and combining ====
A sword can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Two swords of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the sword's enchantments.


=== Mob loot ===

Some mobs can spawn with a sword and have an 8.5% chance of dropping them upon death caused by player. This chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, up to a maximum of 11.5% with Looting III. Zombies and husks can drop iron swords, zombified piglins and piglins can drop golden swords, and wither skeletons can drop stone swords. The dropped sword is usually badly damaged and may be enchanted. Stone swords dropped by wither skeletons are never enchanted.
A vex wields an iron sword that normally has a 0% chance of dropping, because their main hand's HandDropChances is 0. However, this chance increases by 1 percentage point per level of Looting. It is never damaged‌ and may be enchanted.
In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn from raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% chance on hard mode) of dropping a damaged iron sword. This sword has a 50% chance of being enchanted.


=== Trading ===

In Bedrock Edition, an apprentice-level weaponsmith villagers sells enchanted iron swords for at least 7-21 emeralds, and a master-level weaponsmith sells enchanted diamond swords for at least 13-27 emeralds.
In Java Edition, a novice-level weaponsmith villager has a 2⁄3 chance of selling an enchanted iron sword for at least 7-22 emeralds. A master-level weaponsmith offers to sell an enchanted diamond sword for at least 11–27 emeralds.
The enchantments of the swords offered by villagers are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

== Usage ==


=== Attacking ===
Pressing attack while holding a sword inflicts damage on both mobs and other players. Upon damaging a mob or player, the sword's durability decreases by 1.
Attacking a boat or a minecart with a sword stone tier or higher instantly destroys it ‌, without decreasing the sword's durability. Otherwise, it requires 2 hits, with neither decreasing durability.


==== Sweeping ====
                                                                           
If the attack recharge meter is 84.8% or above and the player is on the ground standing or moving slower than the sprinting speed in a straight line, the sword performs a sweeping attack indicated by a gale particle that reaches nearby enemies for 1 and knocks them back; the amount of knockback is 80% that of the basal knockback and does not benefit from the knockback enchantment. As result, the player can perform a sweep attack while they are sprinting diagonally but it is impossible to perform a sweep attack at the same time as a critical hit or while riding some entity. All enemies within an 1 by 0.25 by 1 block area of any part of the attacked mob and whose feet are 3 or less blocks away from player's feet are affected. The sweeping edge enchantment increases the damage dealt by 50% of the normal hit damage for level I, 67% for level II and 75% for level III.


=== Damage ===


==== Java Edition ====
Swords have an attack speed of 1.6 and take 0.625 seconds to recover. 


==== Bedrock Edition ====
In Bedrock Edition, swords have no attack cooldown, as in bedrock damage speed is only limited by damage immunity,or sweep attack, and deal the following damage:

The most amount of damage that a sword enchanted with Sharpness V can do is 11 in Java Edition and 15.25 in Bedrock Edition, without critical hits.


=== Sword breaking times ===

A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.
If a sword is enchanted with Silk Touch, either using Creative or commands, cobwebs the sword destroys will drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string. This is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.
The following table shows the time it takes to break blocks on which swords have any effect. Colors indicate what gets dropped:

White: an original block.
Blue: block's normal drop (e.g. seeds, sapling, apple).
Red: nothing.


==== Safety around constructions ====
In Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, care must still be taken around minecarts, paintings, item frames,‌ and armor stands; these are entities, thus can be broken with swords in Creative.


=== Enchantments ===
Swords can receive, gathered from mob drops/villager trades or be found in various loot chests (example: End City, Bastion Remnant)with the following enchantments:

Golden swords have the highest enchantibility  but the least durability.


=== Fuel ===
Wooden swords can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1 item per sword.


=== Smelting ingredient ===


=== Piglins ===
Piglins are attracted to golden swords, run toward any golden swords on the ground and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory. This very often causes piglins pick  the sword of their fallen friends.

=== Blocking ===

Previously, since the Adventure Update, all types of swords could be used to parry to block some forms of damage. If the player is blocking with a sword when attacked, the sword deflects 50% of incoming damage from melee, non-magical projectiles like arrows, and explosions, along with minimizing airborne knockback. The sword is held in front of the player and its durability is not reduced by blocking. The player moves at a slower rate than sneaking if blocking with a sword. Sword blocks could be engaged and disengaged instantly, with no delay between the input and damage mitigation nor cooldown between lowering a block and raising a new one.
After the Combat Update, the sword blocking functionality was replaced by blocking with shields and to accommodate the dual wield system. Shields negate more damage and knockback than sword blocking from "blockable" attacks (they block 100% damage and knockback after Java Edition 1.11), but, unlike swords, they lose durability, have a 0.25 second startup period before damage can be mitigated and can be temporarily disabled by attacks with an axe.
Although most editions continued past 1.9,most Legacy Console Edtions still have blocking and no shields.


=== Knockback ===
The knockback dealt by swords used to be higher than while the players are using another melee items, like an axe or with the hands. This feature was removed in Java Edition 1.9 and is also no longer used in Bedrock Edition.

== Trivia ==
The sword's traditional texture came from Notch's abandoned RPG, Legend of the Chambered. The iron sword's texture was created first, as it was from the game, and the other swords followed.
In Java Edition, with the introduction of netherite swords, it is possible to one-hit kill undead mobs in the game (except withers and zombies/skeletons with random armor) using a sword with the Smite V enchantment, without the need to perform a critical hit (this was previously possible only with a Smite V stone, iron, or diamond axe).
Plastic diamond and enchanted swords are official Minecraft merchandise.
In the game Transformice, a diamond sword can be found in the shop.
