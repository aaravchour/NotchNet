A trial key is an item found in trial chambers. It is used to unlock vaults


== Obtaining ==
The trial key can be obtained from trial spawners (50%), or from decorated pots and chests (8%).


== Usage ==
The Trial Key is used in the trial chambers to open vaults, which give good loot. Using one on any Trial Vault will result in the key being removed from the player's inventory. Only one Trial Key is required per vault. Once it is opened and loot dispensed, it cannot regain loot or take Trial Keys. 


== Appearance ==
A Trial Key has a rocky skull face, most likely made of tuff, as the head of the key and a long copper shaft.

== Trivia ==
When trial keys were first introduced in snapshot 23w45a, their functionality remained a mystery for a pretty good time.
However, in the Minecraft Monthly of January 2024, it was revealed that they open vaults, which, once unlocked, will drop useful loot like armor, emeralds, crossbows, wind charges, etc.
