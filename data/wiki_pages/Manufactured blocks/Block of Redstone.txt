A block of redstone is a mineral block equivalent to nine redstone dust. It acts as a permanently powered redstone power source that can be pushed by pistons.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===
In each ancient city, 2 blocks of redstone can be found integrated into circuitry within a secret room at the city center.


=== Breaking ===
A block of redstone can be mined using any pickaxe (unlike redstone ore, which requires an iron pickaxe or better). If mined without a pickaxe, a block of redstone drops nothing.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
A block of redstone can be used as a redstone power source and can be crafted back into redstone dust. It can also be used as storage if the player's inventory is full of redstone dust from mining.


=== Crafting ingredient ===
Blocks of redstone can be crafted back into redstone dust, and thus provide compact storage for redstone, like other blocks of materials (block of iron, block of gold, etc.).


=== Redstone component ===

To place a block of redstone, use the Place Block control.
Blocks of redstone are always active and cannot be turned off. A block of redstone:

powers any adjacent redstone dust, including above or below, to power level 15
powers any adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from the block of redstone to power level 15
activates any adjacent mechanism components (doors, redstone lamps, etc.), including above or below, with the exception of pistons, which cannot be activated by any power source directly in front of them
Adjacent opaque blocks are not powered.
If a redstone torch is attached to a block of redstone, it deactivates after 1 redstone tick and does not reactivate (which is normal behavior for a redstone torch attached to a powered block).
A block of redstone can be moved by a piston. Water and lava flow around a block of redstone without affecting it.
