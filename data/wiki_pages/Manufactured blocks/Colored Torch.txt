Colored torches are torches colored by metal chlorides, available in blue, red, purple, and green.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Colored torches break instantly and drop as items when mined using any tool or by hand. Tools do not lose any durability after mining them.
Colored torches are also broken if pushed by a piston.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
Torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some require sneaking (see placement for exceptions). Being non-solid, torches have no collision box.
Gravity-affected blocks like sand and gravel do not fall if the block below them has a torch on it and break when falling onto a torch.


=== Light ===
Torches emit a light level of 14. Torches also melt snow layers within 2 blocks and ice within 3 blocks (taxicab distance). Colored torches emit normal light, not colored light, and therefore the coloring is purely aesthetic.


=== Placement ===
In general, torches can be placed only on solid, opaque, full blocks; exceptions are listed below.
