=== Breaking ===
Dripstone blocks require a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. It can be blown up by TNT, in which case it also drops itself.


=== Natural generation ===

Dripstone blocks can be found in dripstone caves. They can generate on the floor, the ceiling, as stalactites, stalagmites, or stalagnates (joined stalactite and stalagmite). They can generate underwater.
