The nether reactor core is an unused block that cannot be obtained with the use of commands.


== Obtaining ==
Nether reactor cores are currently unobtainable in new worlds except through inventory editing or add-ons. It is not available through commands or Creative. The block is, however, still usable for decoration in older worlds that had the block prior to it becoming unobtainable. In Survival Mode, new Nether Reactor Core cannot be crafted, including in worlds with the block, so once placed, the block would be lost if broken. In Creative Mode it is still possible to use Pick Block on existing Nether Reactor Cores to get the block into the inventory.


=== Breaking ===
Mining a nether reactor core using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch yields the same drop as an unenchanted pickaxe. They drop 3 diamonds and 6 iron ingots.


== Usage ==
Prior update 0.12.0 when Mojang added the nether dimension, the nether reactor core served as a placeholder to obtain nether-exclusive items like glowstone and nether quartz while the nether is yet to be implemented. It is activated by placing and tapping the nether core in a specific pattern using gold blocks and cobblestone. 
Even though the nether core is removed after 0.12.0, it doesn't get removed in old worlds. Players can break the nether core to get back the diamonds and iron ingots that was used to craft it. It is treated as a novelty item by veteran minecraft players.
