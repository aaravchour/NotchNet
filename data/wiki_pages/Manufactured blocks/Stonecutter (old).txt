The stonecutter was a decorative block that had no other functions.


== Obtaining ==
Stonecutters were available in the creative inventory‌, by pick blocking an existing stonecutter in the world or by using third-party software.


=== Breaking ===
An old stonecutter required a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it dropped itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining was slower and it dropped nothing.


== Usage ==
Stonecutters could be used only for decoration.

== Trivia ==
The stonecutter was originally added to Pocket Edition due to a lack of space in the Minecraft Advanced Touch Technology Interface System (MATTIS) crafting screen, prior to the redesign in v0.9.0 alpha.
The stonecutter has never been usable in New Nintendo 3DS Edition, as its first version was based on Pocket Edition v0.15.4 alpha, two major releases after the removal of the stonecutter's functionality.
The new stonecutter can be considered a revamped version of this block, because it has similar functionality to this one.
