The stonecutter is used to craft stone and copper related blocks in smaller and more precise quantities than crafting, and is more efficient than crafting for certain recipes. It also serves as a stone mason's job site block.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===
Stonecutters can generate inside stone mason houses in villages. They can also spawn in trail ruins.


=== Breaking ===
A stonecutter can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe it drops nothing.‌


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==


=== Cutting ===

The stonecutter can be used as an alternative to the crafting table to craft most stone-related blocks. All of its recipes require just one ingredient and produce one product (in varying quantities). It allows skipping steps to craft certain blocks; for example, a stone block can be directly turned into chiseled stone bricks, but requires multiple steps with crafting. 
Stonecutting is also more efficient than crafting for certain recipes. Crafting stairs is more efficient with a stonecutter than a crafting table, as 6 full blocks are crafted into 4 stairs, while stonecutter yields 1 stair per full block. The recipe for cut copper is even more efficient: with stonecutting, 1 block of copper turns into 4 blocks of cut copper, allowing the amount of copper blocks to be quadrupled.
The GUI contains a block selection menu that is empty. The menu is populated with blocks that can be crafted from that particular material, only if a block is inserted into its input.


=== Changing profession ===
If a village has a stonecutter that has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby villager who has not yet chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to a stone mason.


=== Note Blocks ===
Stonecutters can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.

Even though the iron blade appears to be spinning rapidly, it deals no damage and has no hitbox.
