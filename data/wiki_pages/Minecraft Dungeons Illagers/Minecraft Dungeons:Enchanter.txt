An enchanter is a hostile illager that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==

The common garb that enchanters wore on a daily basis consisted of a wine-colored robe and cape, each outlined with a golden trim, much like that of an evoker, though the robe also had diamonds engraved into the shoulders. In addition, enchanters each possessed a turban-like hat with a flickering diamond in the center and carried around an enchanter's tome to enchant nearby hostile mobs. They close their hands much like evokers and illusioners when standing idle.
In some official Minecraft Dungeons books, enchanters have their shoulders phase through their head.


=== Lore ===
Three enchanters within the Pumpkin Pastures enchant a few vindicators and zombies to attack Hal, though they fail when Hal defeats the mobs before defeating them along with a spider. Much later, a group of "enchanted scholars" gather within the Highblock Halls before a hero invades their gathering, causing them to enchant their nearby allies to defeat the hero.


== Spawning ==


== Relations ==
Enchanter's Tome – Meant only to be wielded by enchanters, this artifact can summon powerful enchantments.
Soul crossbow – Crafted by the mysterious evokers and enchanters of the woodland mansions.


== Behavior ==

Enchanters are relatively weak, non-combative, and slow. Instead they mostly cast spells to make any allies stronger.

Walk
Enchanters will raise their eyebrows sadistically while walking.

Basic attack

Enchanters hit and chase a target with their tome if they get too close (2.2 blocks), dealing light damage.

Enhance

Enchanters enchant up to two nearby mobs individually, increasing their stats and applying the Double Damage or Fast Attack enchantments onto them. An enchanted beam links an enchanter with a targets. If a target strays too far or an enchanter is defeated, the enchantment ends on that target. Enchanters cannot enchant other enchanters. Enchanting geomancers and iceologers doubles the damage of their geomancer bombs and ice chunks.

Novelty

An unused behavior in game. However this pose can be found within the Minecraft Dungeons loading screen as well as within an official image used for advertisement in the original game's start screen, prior to Minecraft Dungeon's release. 

Stun
Although enchanters can be stunned, they use the idle animation when they are stunned.


== Sounds ==
The idle, hurt and death sounds of the enchanter include distorted villager sounds.
