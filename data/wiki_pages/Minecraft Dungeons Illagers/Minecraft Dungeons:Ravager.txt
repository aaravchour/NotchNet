A ravager is a large hostile mob that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
Ravagers are bull-like mobs possessing dark skin and a large tanky body, with towering legs covered in silvery armor, a saddle on their back, and a large head with green eyes, two horns, an illager nose, and a maw of sharp teeth. Unlike the mob in the original Minecraft game, these mobs have the ability to move their mouth, eyes, and having more chains and accents to their armor.

== Behavior ==
Ravagers have three different behaviors. They can't be stunned by normal attacks, except Shock Powder and any weapon with the Stunning enchantment.

Bite
Ravagers ram their target with its head, dealing a lot of damage and knocking them back.

Heavy attack
Ravagers will paw the ground with their legs before very quickly run towards the target and bite them. This attack does even more damage than the regular bite.

Roar
Ravagers will occasionally roar violently, knocking away any nearby mobs or heroes a great distance but won't deal any damage.

== Trivia ==
Despite looking like an illager, ravagers are not illagers and are not affected by Illager's Bane, making it the only illager which are not affected by Illager's Bane. 
On the Ravager page on Minecraft.net, they are jokingly compared metaphorically as a very enraged cow.
