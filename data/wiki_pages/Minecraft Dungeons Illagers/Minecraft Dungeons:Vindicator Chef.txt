== Behavior ==
Vindicator chefs have the same AI as a regular vindicator, having the same health and behaviors as them. Vindicator chefs raise their main hand, brandishing a ladle, dealing the same amount of damage as a regular vindicator.

Strong attack
Vindicator chefs attack the hero on sight. They have high movement speed. Their attack speed is slightly slower than zombies but they deal more damage and are tougher. They have more delay than other melee mobs when attacking. However, they can easily catch up to hero as they can move while attacking.

Retreat
Vindicator chefs retreat after hitting a hero, similar to baby zombies. When they retreat, they lower their ladles.

Target lock
Vindicator chefs turn to "lock onto the hero" if they run more than fifteen blocks away. Once triggered, Their charge speed is slightly increases and they no longer retreat after hitting but chase the hero until death or aggressivness is exhausted.

Aggressive
Vindicator chefs become aggressive if a hero stands within their taunt circle. If hurt by hero, its attack speed increases and its charge speed decreases. An aggressive vindicator chef always raises its ladles, even when retreating.

Novelty
If the hero is surrounded by a large group of vindicator chefs and has already been attacked by some of them, the vindicator chef that has been retreated or outside the battlefield will do a call out behavior called "Novelty" before their next charges and attacks, as one of the easter eggs in the game.
