== Appearance ==
A drowned necromancer is a large drowned dressed in an outfit similar to a Necromancer. It wears a dark-blue hood fitted with two gold accents that resemble a crown and large shoulder pads with torn edges and gold rims, and on the back, a long blue cape with torn edges. Under its hood, it wears torn purple clothes and various gold accents like a belt and armbands. It holds a unique staff that resembles a trident but instead is black, has a blue orb on between the spikes, with light blue tips on the spikes.


== Behavior ==
Drowned necromancers have three attacks that they utilize to fend off heroes.

Basic attack
Drowned necromancers shoot several steam projectiles at heroes, dealing a small amount of damage on impact.

Strong attack
Drowned necromancers summon drowned, trident drowned, and their variants to assist them. They usually summon about two drowned at a time.

Trident storm
Drowned necromancers wave their trident in the water, conjuring tridents to fall from above. The tridents explode on impact, and fall at random times.
