A husk is a zombie variant that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==

Husks resemble their appearance within the original game. The only difference is that they walk in a hunched position and are bigger in size than zombies. In the trailers they have the old texture of husks from the original game.


== Spawning ==
Soggy Swamp (Summoned by the corrupted cauldron)
Arch Haven (Ancient Hunt)
Cacti Canyon
Desert Temple
Lower Temple
Daily Trial
Tower


== Behavior ==
Husks cannot be stunned by normal attacks, except shock powder and any weapon with the Stunning enchantment.

Strong attack

Husks attack nearby heroes and pets with their fists, similar to zombies in terms of speed but slower. They have higher defense, making them harder to defeat than normal zombies.

Novelty

Husk sometimes stretch when idle, as one of the easter eggs in the game.

In the arcade edition, Husk have the exact same height, health, and behavior as zombies, except they also have direct variant.
