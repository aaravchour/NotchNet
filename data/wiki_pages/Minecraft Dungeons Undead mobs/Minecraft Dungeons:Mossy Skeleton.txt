A mossy skeleton is an undead skeleton variant that can be found within the jungle awakens DLC of Minecraft Dungeons. Mossy skeletons have three variants as well as a melee variant that can be found exclusively within the arcade edition.

Mossy skeletons have vines and moss covering the entirety of their body. Small patches of moss can be found surrounding their head, and vines entangled around their ribcage.
