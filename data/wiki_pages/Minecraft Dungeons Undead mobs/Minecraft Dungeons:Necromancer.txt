A necromancer is an undead hostile mob that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==

Necromancers are  large skeletons that wear blue turfs, a cape with blue stripes near the end, a golden belt with a blue gem in the middle, has greenish eyes, and wears a gold crown-like headwear. Necromancers always hold a staff with a blue orb placed upon a stick. They look similarly to the Nameless One but are slightly smaller, about 2.5 blocks tall, and wear a purple robe with blue markings.

== Behavior ==
Basic attack

Necromancers use their staff to summon zombies to attack heroes. They summon mobs much more often than the Nameless One. Should the hero get too close, necromancers immediately flee until they are a safe distance from the hero, and then summon mobs again.

Strong attack

Necromancers also rapidly fire damaging laser orbs from their staff to heroes. The laser orbs deal less damage than the zombie's melee attack but more damage than the skeleton's ranged attack, and they also knock the hero back.

Novelty

Necromancer sometimes throws it's staff into the air while idling. As one of the easter eggs in the game.

== History ==


== Trivia ==
A necromancer was seen summoning drowned within the reveal for the hidden depths. However, it was a placeholder for drowned necromancers, the aquatic variant of the mob. Despite this, it can spawn on the land section within the abyssal monument.
Necromancers have a rare idle animation where they throw their staff in the air, then strike a pose in celebration.
A necromancer's laugh can be heard in 0:30 Caves & Cliffs part one trailer.
