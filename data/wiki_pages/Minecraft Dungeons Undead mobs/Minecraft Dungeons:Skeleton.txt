A skeleton is an undead hostile mob that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons. Skeletons have three direct variants.


== Appearance ==

Skeletons in Minecraft Dungeons are different in color from their counterparts in the original game, with their bones being marble-colored and parts near its legs or joints being darker. Skeletons are left-handed.
Some skeleton are slightly taller than others, and have more health and defense. The first skeleton variant possesses a longbow, the second variant possesses the power bow. Both of these variants wear reinforced mail, which can appear either with both a helmet and chestplate or just a helmet. In the arcade edition, they have melee variants.


== Spawning ==

Skeletons also spawn when night falls, regardless of the mission, and when at least one hero dies in multiplayer.


== Behavior ==
Skeletons attempt to position themselves at a set distance from the hero.
Skeletons shoot arrows normally underwater without being slowed down, unlike their original game counterpart.

Walk

Skeletons flee when the hero gets near. If the player is stationary, the skeleton repeatedly shoot without moving.

Bow action

Skeletons harm the hero by shooting arrows from shortbows at a distance.

Novelty

Skeletons have a rare behavior when idle, in which they spin their skull rapidly as if playing with their heads. They have a sound file named "novelty spin" that plays when this behavior occurs as one of the easter eggs within the game.
