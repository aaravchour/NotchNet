A stray is a skeleton variant that can be found within the Creeping Winter DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
Strays retain their appearance from the original Minecraft game, with the only difference being that they are slightly brighter than the original, making it’s appearance very similar to their appearance before the Texture Update of the original Minecraft game.


== Spawning ==
Frosted Fjord
Lone Fortress
Lost Settlement
Chills and Thrills
Tower
Festival of Frost


== Behavior ==
Bow action
Strays behave the same as normal skeletons, but they shoot arrows that inflict the Freezing effect which will slow the hero down for a short time.

Walk
Strays flee when the hero gets near.

Novelty
Strays have a rare behavior when idle, in which they spin their skull rapidly as if playing with their heads. They have a sound file named "novelty spin" that plays when this behavior occurs.
