== Appearance ==
Sunken skeletons are an underwater variant of the skeleton. They look similar to the mossy skeletons from Jungle Awakens with the green patches of algae on its head and upper ribcage resembling vines and plants. On the right side of its face is a long patch of purple coral growing out of its eye, and on its legs and chest are smaller patches of purple coral growing on the bone.
Sunken skeletons have two variants. The first variant holds a Heavy Crossbow and has red coral growing on one of their eyes and on their ribcage and legs. The second variant has large yellow coral growing on one of their eyes and smaller coral patches on their ribcage and legs. They are seen holding an Elite Power Bow.


== Behavior ==
Like their land-based counterparts, they attack the hero via ranged with their weapons with the unique ability being it fires harpoons instead of arrows, allowing for smoother water movement.
