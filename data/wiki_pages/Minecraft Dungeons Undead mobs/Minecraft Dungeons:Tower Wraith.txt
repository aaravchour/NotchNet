A tower wraith is a hostile tower keeper wraith variant that can be found within the Tower of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
Tower wraiths have the appearance of partial floating skeletons whose mouth and eyes glow bright blue. They wear gilded cloaks, like tower guards, and a color-shifting robe that appears as black or pink.


== Spawning ==
Tower


== Behavior ==
Tower wraiths attack using soul fire or noxious gas, depending on the color of their robe.
They are unaffected by the smiting enchantment.
Tower wraiths have four different behaviors.

Mode change
Tower wraiths occasionally will spin in place, changing the color of their robe. 

Teleport
Tower wraiths teleport away when a target gets too close. Attacking or stunning a tower wraith while it is teleporting cancels the teleport, though the tower wraith remains invisible for a few seconds.

Poison cloud attack
Pink tower wraiths summon noxious gas clouds on the hero.
