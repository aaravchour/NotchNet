The Undead were mobs that were neither living nor dead. Unlike in the main Minecraft game, the Undead do not burn in sunlight due to the terms of agreement of the Nameless One's alliance with the Arch-Illager. They are, however, still affected by smiting. They appear in many missions. However, unlike in the main Minecraft game, some mobs did not have a texture update.
