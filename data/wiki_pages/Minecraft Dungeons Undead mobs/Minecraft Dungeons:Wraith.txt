A wraith is an undead mob that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

== Behavior ==

While wraiths are immune to their own Ice Bouquet, they still take damage from fire and soul fire.

Basic attack
Wraiths attack their target by creating a 3×3 area of a scorching Ice Bouquet on the ground under the hero. The flames damage the hero (and allies) and cause damage over time. Other enemies do not take damage from the Ice Bouquet. The Ice Bouquet does not deal damage after the hero has left (they do not inflict Burning). Attacking or stunning a wraith while they are trying to attack cancels the attack. Wraiths can rarely summon a cross pattern of the Ice Bouquet.

Teleport
Wraiths can teleport away from targets that get too close. Attacking or stunning a wraith while they are teleporting cancels the teleport, though they remain invisible for a few seconds.

Novelty
Wraiths sometimes swing itself while idling, as one of the easter eggs in the game.
