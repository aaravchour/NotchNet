== Trivia ==
Zombies have many unused sounds in game file.
Both shoulder pads use the shoulder pad model on the right. One of the right shoulder pads was reversed and disguised as the left shoulder pad. The difference between the reversed right shoulder pad and the left shoulder pad is that there is an extra white pixel on the top of the left shoulder pad.
