Zombified piglin hunters are hostile mobs found in Minecraft Dungeons in the Flames of the Nether DLC. They act as the zombified piglin's ranged variant.


== Spawning ==
Nether Wastes
Warped Forest
Crimson Forest


== Appearance ==
Zombified piglin hunters in Minecraft Dungeons are similar in appearance to their default counterpart in the base game with the slight exception that they have the ability to use crossbows.
Zombified piglin hunters have variants. The first variant is seen wearing a black armor set and has one gold guard on its left arm, and wearing a cracked netherite helmet and leather belt with gold accents, while the second variant is seen wearing a black-blue armor set has two gold guards on its arms, and wearing a cracked Gold helmet. They both are equipped with a crossbow.


== Behavior ==
Zombified piglin hunters act similarly to their living counterparts where they spawn with a crossbow and attack the hero by shooting arrows. They can noticeably shoot faster than the pillager, but won't do a lot of damage.


== Sounds ==


== History ==


== Trivia ==
Zombified piglin hunters are seen holding crossbows, which zombified piglins can do in the base game, but they cannot use them.
There’s currently a bug where they have the same sounds as normal piglins. The same goes to the Zombified Fungus Thrower
