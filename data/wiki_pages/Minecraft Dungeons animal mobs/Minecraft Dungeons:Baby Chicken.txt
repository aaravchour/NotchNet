The baby chicken is a cosmetic pet mob that can be found within the ultimate DLC bundle and the hero pass of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
The baby chicken has a similar appearance to an adult chicken, but with a much smaller body. It appears identical to baby chickens from the original game.


== Obtaining ==
Ultimate DLC Bundle
Hero Pass


== Behavior ==
The baby chicken is purely cosmetic and does not attack enemies, nor do any enemies target it. However, it may die from falling off the map (or walking through unsafe areas of the map). It will also appear to benefit from using a consumable item or artifact. However, it can be used to activate the mines of redstone golems. Unlike its adult counterpart, the baby chicken is passive and will not harm the hero.

== History ==


== Trivia ==
The baby chicken is seen in a Twitter video absentmindedly wandering dangerously close to the nether portal close to the church within the camp, being prevented twice from entering by the hero, Adriene.
