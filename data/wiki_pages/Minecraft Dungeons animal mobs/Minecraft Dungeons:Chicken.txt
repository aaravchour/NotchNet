A chicken is a hostile mob found usually together with baby zombies to form chicken jockeys and chicken jockey towers, found in Minecraft Dungeons. In Minecraft Dungeons:Arcade, they are instead passive and are an exclusive pet.


== Spawning ==
Creeper Woods
Soggy Swamp (Summoned by the corrupted cauldron)
Pumpkin Pastures
Arch Haven
Cacti Canyon
Broken Citadel (Cinematic)
Tower
Daily Trial
Chicken jockeys can also spawn when night falls, regardless of location, when at least one hero dies in multiplayer.


== Behavior ==
Unlike chickens from the base game, chickens are hostile and attack the hero with a kick. In Minecraft Dungeons Arcade however, they are passive and follow the hero as pets.


== Chicken (passive) ==

A passive chicken is a passive mob that can be found standing idly next to Enchantsmith's stall in the camp. It cannot be interacted with.

== Trivia ==
A passive chicken was going to be present in the Camp, but it was scrapped alongside the enchantsmith. The chicken seems to sit idly in position. It cannot be attacked.
