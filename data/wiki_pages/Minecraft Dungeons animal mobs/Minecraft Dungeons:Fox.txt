The fox is a pet mob that is obtainable within the Cloudy Climb seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons. It has a variant that was added previously within the Creeping Winter DLC. The fox also makes an appearance in the Arcade spin-off as a summonable mob. It was originally seen in the Cross Platform Play Trailer, long before it was officially added.


== Appearance ==
Foxes overall appear similar to their counterparts in the main Minecraft game, having orange fur, black ears, long snouts, and a bushy tail ending in white fur.


=== Lore ===
In the main section of the Camp, the fox was being adored alongside the spotted baby pig. Sometime presumably later, a hero in wolf armor tried to entertain the fox with a theatrical backflip somewhere in the Mainland. However, the fox was not interested in the hero's theatrics.
