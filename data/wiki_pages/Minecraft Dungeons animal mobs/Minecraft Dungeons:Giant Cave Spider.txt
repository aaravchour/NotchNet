== Spawning ==
Cacti Canyon (Arcade)


== Behavior ==
The giant cave spider is a fast boss with strong attacks and quick maneuvers as a way to avoid attacks. What makes this boss hard is due to the many spiders and cave spiders that surround the hero in the arena. The giant cave spider has three different attacks:
