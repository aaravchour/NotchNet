A panda is a passive animal that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Spawning ==
Panda Plateau
Treetop Tangle


== Behavior ==
They will also spawn trapped in bamboo cages where the hero must free them, or sitting around the end of the mission, occasionally rolling around. They have a rare chance of spawning as a brown panda. They also make an appearance in the spin-off game Minecraft Dungeons Arcade as a summonable pet. Pandas usually stay and sit within one spot and roll or walk around the mission. Rarely they can spawn enchanted, but are mostly harmless. Pandas also retain some of their personalities just like in the original game. Unlike their original counterparts, they can clap their paws and wave at the hero when close, this behavior is seen at the near-end area of the Panda Plateau. Pandas are non-attackable when they are the objective mob and when they are in the near-end area of the mission.
In Arcade, they follow the hero and attack nearby mobs by mauling them.
