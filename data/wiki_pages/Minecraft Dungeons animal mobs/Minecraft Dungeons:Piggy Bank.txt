A piggy bank, also known as a loot pig, is a rare passive animal that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons. If attacked by a hero, they drop emeralds and various loot.


== Appearance ==

A piggy bank is a pig that possesses wider eyes and its pupils are in the middle. It carries a fancy chest on its back attached via a strap. Piggy banks have the same eye shape as Endermen.

== Behavior ==

A piggy bank, when it appears, stands still, looking somewhat cautiously for heroes and mobs, while wobbling under the pressure of the chest. When a piggy bank is hit by a hero, it widens its eye, then drops emeralds and is stunned for a short time. If the hero successfully kills it, it drops more loot. If left alone on screen for long enough, however, it eventually disappears along with the chest, without dropping loot.

Alerted

When the hero gets close to a piggy bank, it would try to flee.
