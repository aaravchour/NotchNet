A rabbit is a passive animal that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
Rabbits in Minecraft Dungeons are larger than their original game counterparts. Unlike rabbits in the original game, they use the brown texture in the arctic atmosphere while the original game, rabbits spawned in tundras are either white or white/black.


== Spawning ==
Frosted Fjord
Lost Settlement


== Behavior ==
Rabbits are often seen roaming around missions, hopping around and sitting still. They have low health due to their small size. Because of the lack of animals like cows or sheep in the DLC, rabbits are in their place, though polar bears can also be found.

== Sounds ==


== Trivia ==
They have unused attack files known as Basic attack and Strong attack.
