A wooly cow is a cow variant that can be found within the howling peaks DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
Wooly cows possess a thick brown coat that droops from its body and face, covering one eye. It has slightly brown skin, separated brown hooves, white horns, and a pink muzzle. The overall appearance resembles Highland Cattle, which have similar traits.


== Spawning ==
Windswept Peaks
Gale Sanctum
Gauntlet of Gales
Colossal Rampart


== Behavior ==
Wooly cows wander around aimlessly mooing, huffing, and shaking occasionally. They have a larger health pool than a normal cow and they avoid water, lava, and fall damage. They flee for a few seconds when harmed. Wooly cows can spawn enchanted like most mobs, though the enchantment is usually status or defense-related.
