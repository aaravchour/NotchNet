=== Behavior ===
An iron golem can be summoned when using a golem kit. Unlike the original game's Iron Golem, Iron golems in Minecraft Dungeons are hostile toward creepers. They can also be hostile toward passive mobs that have been attacked by a hunting bow or its unique variants. An iron golem uses the same attack animations as the enderman. They can withstand significant damage. An iron golem has two types of attacks:

Basic attack
Iron golems walk over to hostile mobs and cause significant damage by swinging their arms.

Strong attack
Iron golems slam both arms onto the ground, causing high damage.

Damage resistance
Although iron golem has lower health than bees, all damage taken by iron golem is halved (0.5x/50%).
