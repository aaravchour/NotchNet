== Usage ==


=== Properties ===
X seconds duration
25 seconds cooldown
The iron hide amulet when used, provides a major boost to defense for a short time. It's identical to that of the oakwood brew.
Testing has shown the damage reduction is 50%. (A normal Zombie hits for 8 damage. With the iron hide amulet active, the damage is reduced to 4). Another test showed that an Apocalypse+15 Zombie hits 36,000. With the iron hide amulet, the damage was reduced to 18,000.
This effect stacks with the damage reduction from armor such as the reinforced mail or mercenary armor, which means damage from Zombies will be reduced to 3 with both effects active. The effect also stacks with the Protection enchantment.
The effect won’t provide damage from the player itself, such as the “Pain Cicle” enchantment or others.


=== Stats ===
The cooldown of the iron hide amulet is 25 seconds fixed.
