== Guardian Vex ==

A guardian vex is a mob that can be summoned within the echoing void DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.


=== Spawning ===
Three guardian vexes can be summoned by using the vexing chant.


=== Appearance ===
Guardian vexes are small mobs with an appearance similar to that of a vex, with some notable differences, such as how it has small ears, large yellow eyes, and thinner wings. It is also a light pinkish color rather than gray like a vex. Guardian vexes also carry a mace around, which they use to attack mobs.


=== Behavior ===
Attack
Guardian vexes attack any and all hostile mobs near the hero with their mace. Similar to bees or soul wizards, they disappear after a while, except unlike other summons, they take constant damage until they die, similar to vexes from the original game.

Immunity
Guardian vexes are immune to damage dealt by evoker fangs like vexes and evokers are.
