The Heart of Ender is the final boss of the Mainland missions of Minecraft Dungeons. It appears atop the Obsidian Pinnacle immediately after the heroes defeat the Arch-Illager.


== Lore ==

The Heart of Ender is the manifestation of the voice that the Orb of Dominance speaks to the Arch-Illager with, as seen in the book The Rise of the Arch-Illager. Through the various actions Archie committed during his reign as the Arch-Illager, it can be inferred that the Heart of Ender is manipulative, cruel, arrogant, apathetic, and merciless. It shows no remorse or guilt for its actions, as shown by Archie’s personality when he was a proxy to the orb. Its main goal is the complete submission and loyalty of all living beings. It is willing to go through with anything, no matter what is necessary, to accomplish this desire. The only emotion that the Heart of Ender shows is its hatred towards its enemies; a hatred so strong that it continues to burn postmortem. This said hatred can sometimes eclipse its intelligence, as its shattered conscience was willing to spread its corruption throughout the land even though those actions put its well being at risk. Its arrogance eventually came to head when its desires of revenge revealed to the world that it survived and had been reborn and currently residing in the endless void between worlds, no longer wishing to rule the Overworld in favor of enacting revenge by destroying all dimensions.


== Appearance ==
The Heart of Ender is a large, half-translucent hostile mob that resembles an enderman. Its head is similar to an enderman’s, but it is slightly elongated and has a more toothy mouth. It has six tendril-like appendages attached to its torso, which gives the Heart of Ender the ability to crawl.


== Behavior ==
The Heart of Ender has four different behaviors. The first is used between each attack, while the other three are used in order. Its behaviors are the most powerful in the game, capable of draining the hero’s health pool within a second.

Spider Crawl
In between its attacks, the Heart of Ender sometimes crawls around the arena, leaving a trail of a black, void-like substance behind it, which deals light damage to the heroes on contact.

Mortar Barrage
The Heart of Ender leans back and spits out a cluster of replicas of the Orb of Dominance from its mouth. When a replica touches the ground, it explodes in a small radius, leaving behind purple flames that damage heroes on contact. This attack is followed up almost immediately with a Cross Beam attack.

Cross Beam
The Heart of Ender raises up and fires four purple beams from its stomach in a plus formation, which spin clockwise, dealing massive damage on contact. This is the Heart of Ender's most damaging attack. 

Arch Visages
The Heart of Ender sinks into the floor as invulnerable Arch Visages in its likeness rise out of the ground. Each Arch Visage that the Heart of Ender fires a purple beam from its mouth, which deals heavy damage before sinking back into the ground. Once all the heads have started firing, the Heart of Ender rises out of the ground, and the attack pattern repeats.

== Trivia ==
The Arch-Illager's distorted laughter can be heard within the heart of ender.
A clear enderman voice can be heard within some of the heart of ender's sounds: mortar barrage, vessel voice, and hurt. The hurt sounds of the heart of ender contain traces of endermen and phantom hurt sounds. The "mortar shoot" noises are also partly sampled from the ender dragon's hurt sounds. The orb's death sound contains a sample of a Wither death sound.
If an entity is standing behind the two short pillars, only one of the arch visages can damage it. However, the chance of one of the arch visages spawning behind the pillars is extremely low.
