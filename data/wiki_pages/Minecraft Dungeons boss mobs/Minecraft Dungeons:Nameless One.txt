The Nameless One is the necromancer boss variant that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
The Nameless One is a large skeleton. It wears a crown of some unknown material over a robe and a belt. It has glowing dark green eyes and has robes with green translucent smoke coming out from underneath it, as it has no legs. Its ribs go over a robe which is remarkably similar to that of a witch. It wields a staff that allows it to summon the vanguards. It was originally the ruler of an ancient civilization of necromancers.


== Spawning ==
Desert Temple (Boss)
Tower (Boss)


== Story ==

In Rise of the Arch-Illager, when Archie is leading the illagers to the Squid Coast, he decides to take a wide arc around the Desert Temple. Unknown to Archie, despite this, the Nameless One knows of the abilities of the Orb of Dominance and sends husks and skeletons to follow the illagers under the cover of darkness. After the illagers launch their raid on the village and Archie is confronted by Yumi, the Undead army appears. They launch their own raid, attacking illagers, villagers, and heroes alike. Archie is shot twice by two skeletons and falls unconscious. Archie wakes up in the midst of being carried to the desert temple and the leading necromancer knocks him out with its staff. He wakes in a prison cell held by a different necromancer who leads him captive to the throne room. In the throne room, Archie meets the Nameless One in person. The Nameless One makes it clear that it desires the Orb of Dominance to make the Undead army immune to sunlight. Archie makes it clear that he will not part with the Orb of Dominance. With both of them trying to gain the upper hand in the tense conversation, they eventually come to an agreement: Archie can use the Orb of Dominance to make the Undead immune to the sunlight and the Nameless One will allow Archie to command the Undead army.
When the heroes first arrive at the Desert Temple, the in-game description of the mission implies that the Nameless One and Archie turned on each other. However, it is vague on which one of the two was the first to betray the other. The description seems to lean more on Archie being the betrayer and desiring the Nameless One’s staff. In the Desert Temple, the heroes see the Nameless One asleep on its throne, surrounded by several sleeping vanguards. When the heroes attempt to grab its staff, they are awakened and attempt to fend off the heroes. Once the Nameless One is defeated, the heroes are free to destroy the staff and leave the Desert Temple.


== Behavior ==
The Nameless One has five behaviors.

Awake source
When the hero first initiates the boss fight, the Nameless One slowly rises from its tomb-like throne, opening its eyes.

Basic attack
The Nameless One fires large, slow-moving green projectiles towards its target current location. Deals heavy damage if it hits. This is its most common attack.

Summon
After a charging animation, the Nameless One summons a wall of seven vanguards between itself and the hero. Used more sparsely.

Strong attack
The Nameless One summons one to seven false kings, which fire one green beam before disappearing. If there are two or more false kings, they will teleport to surround the hero and all fire green beams at the hero.

Teleport
When not attacking, it teleports away from the hero and hovers in one spot. But when the hero attacks it first, then it attacks.


== False king ==

A false king is a mirror image of the Nameless One that is summoned to confuse the hero similarly to the illusioner’s behavior within the Creeping Winter DLC.


=== Behavior ===
Strong attack
They often teleport in a ring formation around the hero and fire one green beam at them, before disappearing. It is not possible to attack these false kings.


== Health ==
The Nameless One has 10,000 HP in the code (before the Redstone Monstrosity have 12,000 HP). On Default I, all mobs have 9.6% health and 12% damage of what is set in the code.
