The tempest golem is a golem boss variant that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Story ==

Upon the shattering of the orb of dominance, one of its shards, landed atop the Howling Peaks. There, it discovered an ancient tempest golem, the ancient protector the gale sanctum, residing solely within the sanctum’s tempest chamber. Upon being corrupted, the golem began to desire and to seek for the means by which to end all life within the Overworld. As the island peaks began to attract much attention, from illagers to heroes, the wind grew all the more extreme due to the golem finding a way to summon a huge storm. After making it to the tempest chamber, the hero activates the two wind pillars, awakening the golem. A long and intense battle ensued, but upon the deactivation of the wind pillars, the hero managed to expose the orb shard within the golem’s mid-section, leaving it open to be destroyed. With the hero’s success, the tempest golem’s Orb induced plan of ending all life was hindered, leaving the wind of the Howling Peaks to breeze free of corruption at last.


== Appearance ==
The Tempest Golem is a colossal golem-like mob. It is made of stone, has a golden back, and has windmill-like poles. Its head is square with a purple stud on its forehead, small eyes, and a big jaw. Jade banners can be seen hanging below the Golem's chin, and its front body possesses intricate etched lines and 4 jade blocks on each end of its body. Both of its arms possess giant gold swords with purple stripes going down the middle, plus its forearms are larger than its upper arms. The Tempest Golem also has a shard of the Orb of Dominance (which is much bigger than the orb itself) in its chest, which is covered by two jade-colored panels with a swirl symbol on them. These two panels are considered its shield, and it protects its shard with them. The golem appears to be 10 to 12 blocks tall (20 to 24 blocks tall in the artwork), which would make it the tallest boss or mob in the game.

Tower (Boss)


== Behavior ==
The Tempest Golem never moves from where it spawned, always remaining immobile similar to the Corrupted Cauldron. It has 4 different attacks. Chilling, Satchel of the Elements, and other freezing abilities do not affect the Tempest Golem's attack speed (However, it does work on the other DLC bosses). The Tempest Golem will be invulnerable to damage unless the two pillars nearby are deactivated, causing it to be stunned temporarily.
The Tempest Golem's melee, shield, and lightning attacks can knock away other mobs, but not damage them.

Sword attack
If a hero goes to either side of the Tempest Golem, it smashes the ground with one of its sword arms, creating a small shockwave around it and deal some or a bit of damage to the hero.

Shield attack
If a hero goes in front of the Tempest Golem's body, it quickly opens its two shield panels, dealing little damage and knocking them away. It then closes them shortly after.

Electric tornado
Occasionally, the Tempest Golem summons a lightning bolt to attack a hero. This is signified by a blue square on the ground which follows them for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds, lightning strikes down on that square, dealing heavy damage. 

Squall golem activation
After the Tempest Golem is stunned and gets back up, or when it is initially activated, 2 squall golems from the back of the arena activate and attack the hero. There are 8 squall golems total in the back.
