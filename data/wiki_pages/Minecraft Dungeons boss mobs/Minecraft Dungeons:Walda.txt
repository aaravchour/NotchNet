Walda was an evoker who used to be the leader of Archie's tribe until Archie stumbled upon the Orb of Dominance which granted him immense power, dropping her place as leader of the tribe. She appears in Minecraft Dungeons:The Rise of the Arch-Illager and she was the one who crowned the Arch-Illager in the opening sequence of the game.


== Story ==
Thord and Archie eventually arrive at the woodland mansion, where they are greeted by the other Illagers. Somehow, Archie has an idea, running past Thord and greeting Walda, the leader of the Illagers. Archie then explains to Walda that the hero had stole the victory from the Illagers, putting the blame on Thord by saying that it was him that thought he could take on a hero all by himself. The other Illagers gasp in response. Archie then asks Walda if she had appointed Thord herself, in which she replies that she did. She then says that the Illagers still haven’t learned the lesson from the last time they died, saying that they still charge into battle without thinking about other dangers. Thord and Archie then have an argument about who was in charge of their particular group, specifically as to who was at fault for the death of the raiding party. Archie then punches Thord, who drops to the ground, clutching his injured leg. Archie yells at him to get up, kicking him in the thigh. Walda then says to Archie that because of his actions, he would be banished from the group of Illagers, seemingly forever.
According to the Nintendo Switch News' Minecraft Dungeons channel article, Walda was the Evoker that was defeated by the heroes at the end of the Pumpkin Pastures mission.
