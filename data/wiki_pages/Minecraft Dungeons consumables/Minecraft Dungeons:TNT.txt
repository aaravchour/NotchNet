TNT is a consumable item that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.


== Appearance ==
TNT appears exactly as it is seen within the original game. There are TNT-minecarts that can be found within a secret area of the colossal rampart.


== Obtaining ==
TNT has a random chance to be dropped by defeated mobs. A hero can then pick it up and carry a maximum of three TNT at any one given time.


== Usage ==
TNT remains above the hero’s head when picked up until they get defeated or throw all TNT that they have by using the shoot bow button. When TNT lands after being thrown, it starts charging; during this time, a circle appears around it, alerting the hero of its massive eight block radius. Once it finishes charging, it explodes, dealing about two times more damage than a creeper's explosion to any entity within its range.


== Behavior ==
The TNT-minecarts within the colossal rampart deal a lot of damage to the hero.
