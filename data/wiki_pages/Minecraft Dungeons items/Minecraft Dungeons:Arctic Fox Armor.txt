== Trivia ==
It was the first item to be revealed and datamined for the chills and thrills event.
Despite being classified as fox armor, a howling sound can be heard from the armor in its drop sounds.
In comparison to its sprite, there is a notable inconsistency, in which the mouth on the sprite is the same as wolf armor and the fox armor, rather than a unique mouth texture to match the in-game texture.
