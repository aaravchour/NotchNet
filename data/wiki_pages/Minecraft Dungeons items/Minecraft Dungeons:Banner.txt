== Raid Captain Chest ==

A Raid Captain Chest is a reward chest that can be found within the mission completion screen of Minecraft Dungeons. When collecting at least one banner, at the end of the mission an additional reward chest is given after the artifact chest at the end of the mission.


=== Power levels ===
The power level of the item in the raid captain chest is increased depending on the amount of banners collected, up to power 256 in normal missions with all six banners collected. This power level is further increased beyond 256 when banners are collected in a daily trial. The amount the power level is increased depends on the tier of the daily trial completed. 

A tier one daily trial at Apocalypse + 25 with all six banners collected can yield an item between power 256 and 259 (average: 258)
A tier two daily trial at Apocalypse + 25 with all six banners collected can yield an item between 258 and 261 (average: 259)
A tier three daily trial at Apocalypse + 25 with all six banners collected can yield an item between 259 and 263 (average: 260)
The chance of getting a 263 item from a tier three daily trial with all six banners collected is incredibly low.


=== Unique items ===
The chance for the item to be unique exponentially increases for every raid captain defeated after the first.


== Data value ==
In the game files, the threat banner is referred to internally by the name Bad_Omen_Captain_Banner.
