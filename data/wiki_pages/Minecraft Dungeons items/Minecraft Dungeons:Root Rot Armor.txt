Root rot armor is an armor that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons. Its unique variant is the Black Spot Armor.


== Appearance ==
Root rot armor is made from jungle vines and roots. It has green glowing eyes, a dark green hood and cloth, as well as a "mask" hiding the hero's face. It has glowing green mushrooms and fungus on the top of the hood and a belt with a corrupted purple prong. The same corrupted purple metal can be found in two peaces protecting the hero's shoulders. The armor also comes with dark green boots, with two dark purple stripes on the front of each boot. Root rot armor is very similar to sprout armor and it's unique variant, the Living Vines Armor, however, it has no in-game connection to any of these being a completely separate piece of armor not belonging to the nether spore armor set.
