== Usage ==
The scatter mines can be used by the hero to place three proximity mines onto the ground, which would then explode when a mob is within range. They appear and behave very similarly to the mines created by redstone golems. This artifact has a twelve second cooldown. Mines automatically explode after ten seconds. They do not deal damage to the hero or allies (although they can still trigger them).
