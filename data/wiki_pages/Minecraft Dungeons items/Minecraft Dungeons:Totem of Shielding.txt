== Usage ==
The totem of shielding is used to block enemy projectiles. When placed, a hexagon of yellow light forms around its position. Enemy projectiles are blocked from all directions, including the heart of ender's laser beams. Projectiles fired by heroes will pass through, with the exception of the Corrupted Beacon's laser beam, and mobs are not blocked from walking into the hexagon. Projectiles are only blocked, not deflected.
