== Usage ==
A bow is the first ranged weapon that can be used in the game.
A bow has moderate power, low speed, and a large ammunition supply. The quiver starts with 80 arrows, normal arrow bundles give 40 arrows, supply chest bundles give another 80 arrows, and surprise gift bundles give 20 arrows.
Bows can be shot immediately for the minimum damage or charged for maximum damage if the ranged attack button is held down. Ranged weapons require the hero to have at least one normal arrow or a special arrow from a quiver artifact in their inventory to shoot. Heroes can also cancel shots by using the melee attack button and releasing the ranged attack button while the melee button is still held.
Damage caused by the arrows can be increased with enchantments, the Strength buff, and certain armors that have ranged damage increases, such as hunter's armor.
