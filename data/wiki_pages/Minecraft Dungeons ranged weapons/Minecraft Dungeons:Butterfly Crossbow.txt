== Usage ==
The butterfly crossbow possesses very low power, high speed, and a large ammo supply. The quiver starts with 133 arrows, normal arrow bundles give 66 arrows, supply chest bundles give another 133 arrows, and Surprise Gift bundles give 33 arrows.
Crossbows can be shot repeatedly if the ranged attack button is held down. Ranged weapons require the hero to have at least one normal arrow or a special arrow from a quiver artifact in their inventory to shoot. Unlike bows, shots from crossbows cannot be charged.
Damage caused by the arrows can be increased with enchantments, the Strength buff, the cowardice armor enchantment, and certain armor have ranged damage increases, such as hunter's armor.
