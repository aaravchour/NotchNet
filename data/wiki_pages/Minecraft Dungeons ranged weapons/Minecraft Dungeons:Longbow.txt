== Usage ==
Longbows possess very high power, low speed, and a moderate ammo supply. The quiver starts with 53 arrows, normal arrow bundles give 26 arrows, supply chest bundles give another 53 arrows, and Surprise Gift bundles give 13 arrows.
Longbows can be shot immediately for the minimum damage or charged for maximum damage if the ranged attack button is held down. Ranged weapons require the hero to have at least one normal arrow or a special arrow from a quiver artifact in their inventory to shoot. Players can also cancel shots by using the melee attack button and releasing the ranged attack button while the melee button is still held. 
Damage caused by the arrows can be increased with enchantments, the Stength buff, and certain armors that have ranged damage increases, such as the hunter's armor.
