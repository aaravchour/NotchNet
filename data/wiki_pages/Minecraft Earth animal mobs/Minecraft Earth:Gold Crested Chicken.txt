The gold crested chicken was a gold-topped variant of the chicken found only in Minecraft Earth.


== Appearance ==
Gold-crested chickens were a golden-topped variant of the chicken. As their name implied, their upper feathers, head, and wings were golden-yellow in color, and their lower body and feathers were white, making it resemble a chick that just hatched with its eggshell stuck on its legs. Its beak and legs had a yellowish or caramel-like tinge. 


== Behavior ==

Gold crested chickens acted exactly the same as normal chickens, walking aimlessly, and avoiding lava.


== Obtaining ==
Gold crested chickens were uncommon mob drops that were only obtainable from chicken tappables.


== Drops ==
When gold crested chickens were killed, they dropped:

0-2 Feather
1 Raw Chicken (Cooked Chicken if killed while on fire)
