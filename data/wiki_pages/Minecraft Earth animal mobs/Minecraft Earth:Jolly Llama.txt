== Appearance ==
Jolly llamas were a festive variant of the llama. Unlike the normal llama, they possessed a unique coat color pattern, being all brown and having a large white patch on its neck and chin. Their nose was a snowy white and they also possessed small gray spots on the tips of their ears. On its head was a green headdress with two antlers, on its neck was a collar filled with small gold bells, and on its back was a green carpet with a unique pattern and red accents on its edges. It lastly possessed grey hooves.


== Behavior ==

Jolly llamas looked for ferns and large ferns and ate them. After eating them, they started prancing around and made a jingling noise when they hopped.


== Obtaining ==
The jolly llama was obtainable by scanning specific QR codes in various parks around the world or by completing a seasonal challenge when available. It was also obtainable by purchasing the "Ranger's Nest" and "Jolly's Lodge" buildplates. Tappables during the holidays or the last challenge season also had a small chance of containing a jolly llama.
