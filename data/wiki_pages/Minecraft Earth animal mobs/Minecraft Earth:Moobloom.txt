The moobloom was a buttercup-covered variant of the mooshroom found only in Minecraft Earth. It was a rare drop of cow tappables. Mooblooms were like mooshrooms except yellow and sprouted buttercups instead of mushrooms.


== Appearance ==
The moobloom was a buttercup-covered variant of the normal cow. Its body was yellow with big white spots scattered throughout its body and head. It had two big black eyes, just like a mooshroom. It had 4 buttercups growing out of it, with three on its back, and one on its head. It had a white muzzle, a dark grey snout, and gray horns.


== Behavior ==

Mooblooms left a trail of yellow flowers as they walked, with each flower they plant having an 50% chance of being a dandelion, a 30% chance of being a sunflower, or a 20% chance of being a buttercup. Otherwise, mooblooms mostly had the same AI behavior as mooshrooms and cows. They wandered aimlessly, mooing and huffing constantly, avoiding lava and cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. 


== Obtaining ==
Mooblooms were a rare mob drop obtainable from cow tappables with a very low 0.6% chance of getting it, making it the rarest cow variant to obtain in Minecraft Earth. It was also obtainable by purchasing the "Roadside Inn" buildplate.


== Drops ==
A Moobloom was able to be sheared for 1 Buttercup.
Just like a normal cow, the moobloom dropped the following when killed:

0–2 Leather
1–3 Raw Beef (Cooked Beef if killed while on fire)

== Trivia ==
It was included in the Minecraft Live 2020 mob vote, but was eliminated, leaving the iceologer and the glow squid to determine the winner, which was the glow squid.
The biome category of the journal revealed that mooblooms spawned in plains rather than flower forests.
In the game Transformice, a Moobloom fur can be found in the shop.
