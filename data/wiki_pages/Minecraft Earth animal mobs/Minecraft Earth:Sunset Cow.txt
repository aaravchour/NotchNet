The sunset cow was a variant of the cow covered in black and golden brown fur exclusively found in Minecraft Earth.


== Appearance ==
Sunset cows were a rather brightly-colored variant of the cow with their whole body covered in a golden-brown coat of fur, with the exception of their face, nape, and back where they have black fur instead. Their head was rather dark in color with a long patch of golden-brown fur on their forehead. They had slightly dark-brown tips on their ears, a white muzzle running around their nose, and dark hooves.


== Behavior ==

Similar to normal cows, sunset cows wandered around, mooing and breathing occasionally. They avoided water, lava and walking off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. They fled for a few seconds when harmed.


== Obtaining ==
Sunset cows were of an uncommon rarity and were obtainable through cow tappables with a 2.5% chance of obtaining. They were also obtainable as a prize in Season 5.


== Drops ==
When killed, the sunset cow dropped:

0-2 Leather
1-3 Raw Beef (Cooked Beef if killed while on fire)
