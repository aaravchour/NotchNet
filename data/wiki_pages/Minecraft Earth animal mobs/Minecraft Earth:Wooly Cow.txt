The wooly cow was a wooly variant of the cow found only in Minecraft Earth, being based off of Highland Cattle.


== Appearance ==
Wooly cows were wooly variants of normal cows. They possessed a thick brown coat which drooped from its body and face, covering its other eye. They had slightly brown skin, seperated brown hooves, white horns, and a pink muzzle. Their overall appearance made them resemble Highland Cattle, which have similar traits.


== Behavior ==

Similar to normal cows, wooly cows wandered around, mooing and breathing occasionally. They avoided water, lava and walking off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. They fled for a few seconds when harmed.


== Obtaining ==
Wooly cows were an uncommon mob drop and had a 4.1% chance to be obtained from cow tappables.


== Drops ==
When killed, an adult wooly cow dropped:

0-2 Leather
1–3 Raw Beef (Cooked Beef if killed while on fire).
1 Brown Wool. (Wooly cows that have not regrown their wool do not drop more wool.)
When sheared, a wooly cow dropped 1–2 Brown Wool.
