A furnace golem was a variant of an iron golem with a blast furnace as its body.


== Appearance ==
Furnace golems were dark gray and beige in color, with gray outlines. Their chest had a grill with three openings where coal was lit, resembling a blast furnace. Its head had a dark gray forehead with two grooves, bright orange and red eyes, and its face became bright orange and red when in a rage state or when seeing a hostile mob. Its arms were dark gray with gray outlines, and the lower half of its body was beige with four gray dots resembling screws on both legs, and its feet ended with a dark brown color.


== Behavior ==
When a furnace golem saw any hostile mob, its face and eyes ignited before attacking, which had a chance of setting the hostile mob on fire. A furnace golem didn't stop attacking until the hostile mob was killed. Once killed, the golem's eyes and face reverted to gray. During the attacks, a furnace golem was also able to light its surroundings on fire, causing blocks to burn and spread flames, which threatened builds.
Furnace golems handed out torches, similar to the iron golem giving poppies to baby villagers. This behavior was triggered randomly by viewing the golem in a certain angle.
Naturally spawned furnace golems found in Adventures were neutral mobs that attacked the player if provoked by being hit.
Furnace golems were also damaged by water.


== Obtaining ==
Furnace golems were a rare mob drop that were found in stone tappables, where it had a very low 0.9% chance of obtaining.


== Drops ==
When killed, the furnace golem dropped:

1–2 Coal
1–2 Iron Nuggets
Furnace golems did not drop blast furnaces, despite having a blast furnace on their body.
