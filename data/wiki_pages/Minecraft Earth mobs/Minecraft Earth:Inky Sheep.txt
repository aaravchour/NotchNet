The inky sheep was a passive mob and a variant of the sheep found only in Minecraft Earth.


== Appearance ==
Inky sheep were a beige-white variant of the sheep. The wool near their face consisted of two black stripes running from the back toward the side of their face, separated by a white patch of wool. Their rear end and legs were completely black in color, hence the name. Unlike other sheep, their face was rather lightly brown in color.


== Behavior ==

Similar to ordinary sheep, inky sheep had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs high enough to cause fall damage.


== Obtaining ==
Inky sheep were an uncommon mob drop from sheep tappables, with a 4.7% chance of obtaining it. It was also previously obtainable as a reward in Season 7.


== Drops ==
When sheared, inky sheep dropped 1-2 black wool.
Upon death, inky sheep dropped:

1 Black Wool
1 Raw Mutton (Cooked Mutton if killed while on fire)
