A mossy sheep  was an unused moss-covered sheep that was seen in Minecraft Earth's farewell tweet, among the many mobs.


== Appearance ==
The mossy sheep appears to be a moss-covered variant of the sheep. Its head and front body are covered in what looks like moss. Due to it being partially covered by other mobs, its full body and appearance are not fully known.
