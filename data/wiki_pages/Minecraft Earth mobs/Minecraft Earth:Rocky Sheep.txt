A rocky sheep was a sheep variant with white wool with black blotches found only in Minecraft Earth.


== Appearance ==
Rocky sheep were a variant of the sheep with various black blotches found on their wool. They had two dark blotches on both sides of their face and a large blotch near their right leg. Their wool seemed to blend into a slightly grayish color as a result of the blotches. They possessed a rather bright pink-colored nose.


== Behavior ==

Similar to normal sheep, rocky sheep had the same AI behavior. They wandered aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs high enough to cause fall damage.


== Obtaining ==
Rocky sheep were an uncommon mob drop found in sheep tappables, with a 3.9% chance of getting one.


== Drops ==
When sheared, rocky sheep dropped 1-3 Gray Wool.
When killed, rocky sheep dropped:

1 Gray Wool
1 Raw Mutton (Cooked Mutton if killed while on fire)
