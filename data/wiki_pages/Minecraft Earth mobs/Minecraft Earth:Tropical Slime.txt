A tropical slime was a variant of a slime with a water-based texture filled with tropical fish.


== Appearance ==
Tropical slimes were an aquatic variant of the slime, which was composed of water and were able to hold two tropical fish within themselves. Their eyes and mouth were dark blue and their body was brighter blue in color. Their outer layer was a lighter blue in color.


== Behavior ==

Tropical slimes had the same AI behavior as slimes. Tropical slimes hopped around while being able to swim in water and climb ladders.
Unlike regular slimes, tropical slimes were passive toward the player at first. However, when a tropical slime was provoked, it became aggressive and attacked. This affected only slimes that were attacked, and did not trigger other slimes in the area to attack.
Even though a tropical slime was the size of a medium-sized slime, it did not split into smaller slimes when killed.


== Obtaining ==
Tropical slimes were available as a rare mob drop in pond tappables with a very low chance of 0.4% of obtaining it. They were also obtainable by purchasing the “Heart of the Jungle” buildplate.


== Drops ==
1 Tropical Fish.
