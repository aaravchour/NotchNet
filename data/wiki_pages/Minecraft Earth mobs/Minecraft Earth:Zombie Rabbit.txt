A Zombie Rabbit was an unused undead type of rabbit seen only in Minecraft Earth's farewell tweet, among the other mobs.


== Appearance ==
Zombie rabbits appear to be an undead type of rabbit, though this is not fully known. Its fur appears to be green in color and it has dark green eyes and a black nose, hence its name, as it resembles a zombie with its dark green skin.


== Trivia ==
The name "Zombie Rabbit" was made as an assumption to what the rabbit variant is, as it is unknown if it is an undead variant or a moss-covered variant.
