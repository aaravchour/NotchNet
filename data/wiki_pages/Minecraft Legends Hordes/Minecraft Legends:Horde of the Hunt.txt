The Horde of the Hunt is a Horde of Piglins led by The Beast within Minecraft Legends.


== Description ==
The Horde of the Hunt bases are significantly less fortified than the other two hordes, with easy-to-scale bone walls in haphazard formations and less buildings, but makes up for it in larger size and significantly more piglins than the other hordes.
Typically, the Horde of the Hunt prefers to attack Villages and Homesteads at night.
