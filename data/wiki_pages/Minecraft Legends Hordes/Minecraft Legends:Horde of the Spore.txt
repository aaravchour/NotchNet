The Horde of the Spore is a Horde led by The Devourer in Minecraft Legends.


== Description ==
The Horde of the Spore's bases don't contain as many piglins as the Horde of the Hunt or as many defenses as the Horde of the Bastion, but their bases tend to be built on multiple plateaus of different sizes, practically necessitating the building of Ramps to reach their Nether Portals.
Typically, the Horde of the Spore prefers to build new outposts at night.
