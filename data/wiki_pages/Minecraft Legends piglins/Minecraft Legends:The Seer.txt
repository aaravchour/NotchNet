The Seer is an elderly Piglin that can be found within the various cutscenes of Minecraft Legends.


== Lore ==

The Seer possesses the Orb of Dominance which they use when called upon by the Great Hog. They used it to turn a beacon into the Night Beacon. Later, The Seer sensed when the Night Beacon was destroyed by the Hero and their allies.
As the Hero keeps destroying Horde of the Hunt portals, the Seer tries to make The Beast go to the Overworld. As The Beast seems to have no interest, the Seer starts to get more impatient. In the  aftermath, The Seer used a large shockwave in order to make The Beast go through a nether portal to the Overworld, which doesn't work. Only when the Seer stops The Beast using its telekinetic powers does The Beast go through the portal.
The Seer remained in the Nether even after the Great Hog was defeated, and thus their fate is currently unknown.
