The Unbreakable is the piglin leader of the Horde of the Bastion, and one of the secondary antagonists and boss units of Minecraft Legends.


== Lore ==

Before the events of the game. The Great Hog summons all of its Horde generals to his map table, where The Unbreakable watches as the The Beast raises its arm up to give The Great Hog a Horde of the Hunt banner, which The Great Hog takes and smashes into a place in the map. The Beast nods in agreement and sends piglins towards the portal, and The Great Hog then laughs menacingly.
Foresight afterwards senses the evil of The Great Hog and its generals coming for the Overworld where Foresight proceeds to tell Action and Knowledge to come with it to the Overworld to investigate the nether portal. They then recruit the Hero to stop the piglins and the Great Hog and its generals.
After the Hero defeats multiple Piglin Outposts, The Unbreakable is seen in the Nether next to The Devourer at the map table, watching The Great Hog choke The Beast before throwing it into a pillar.
The Unbreakable is later seen with The Great Hog and other generals as they attack the piglin in a fit of rage when hearing the Night Beacon was destroyed, and they proceed to catch the piglin and presumably kill it. The Unbreakable and the other generals then return to their respective horde bases.
During the war the Hero successfully destroys a Horde of the Bastion outpost with a Nether portal in it. A piglin comes through the portal just in time before it explodes, clutching a Portal Guard flail. The piglin struggles but drags the flail towards The Unbreakable's throne, with the other piglins around him are stopping and watching curiously. The piglin arrives in The Unbreakable's throne, and the leader of the Hoard of the Bastion notices the piglin, and gives a jerk of his head. The piglin then raises the flail for The Unbreakable to see. The Unbreakable is infuriated by the outcome of the battle and flings the piglin that is fixing his gauntlet into the lava below and approaches the piglin with the flail, and growls angrily at it.
After the next Horde of the Bastion base falls because of the Hero, we see The Unbreakable instructing a group of Brutes and a Portal Guard leading them. The Unbreakable blasts a piglin imitating the Portal Guard with his gauntlet and gives the Portal Guard the signal, and the Portal Guard leads the piglins into the Overworld. After the piglins enter the Nether portal, it raises his golden gauntlet into the air, spinning it with a maniacal laugh as the portal's glow illuminates its face.
After a third Horde of the Bastion base crumbles, The Unbreakable decides to go to the Overworld to kill the Hero itself. While walking towards a Nether portal, it stops to shoot at captured Overworld animals, a piglin and the Hero replica placed by the piglin on the map table after the Night Beacon base falls. While aiming for the Hero replica, though, its gauntlet malfunctions again and The Unbreakable misses, sending the fireball towards two piglins. The Unbreakable tells the accompanying three piglins to fix its gauntlet, and afterwards, it once again aims for the Hero replica and successfully destroys it before heading through the portal.
After arriving, it sees the Hero looking at it and its base. It roars at the Hero and flings some piglins into the air to try and intimidate the hero. After a ferocious and long battle it is weakened. In its final moments the Unbreakable tries to shoot the Hero with his gauntlet, only for the gauntlet's magma generator on its back to overheat and explode. The Unbreakable attempts to stand back up, but ultimately collapses for the final time.


== Spawning ==
After successfully destroying all the Horde of the Bastion bases, a final base will appear. This base contains a ring of walled defenses surrounded by lava, with a bridge leading to the portal area, which awaits the Unbreakable.
