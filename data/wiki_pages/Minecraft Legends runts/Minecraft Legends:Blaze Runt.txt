A blaze runt is a piglin runt that wields a blaze rod within Minecraft Legends.


== Spawning ==
Blaze Runts spawn in piglin pits within piglin outposts. Blaze Runts also randomly spawn in every biome.


== Drops ==
Blaze runts drop lapis.


== Behavior ==
Blaze runts idle around in the world until finding an enemy mob, enemy buildings or attacked by mobs. Blaze runts throw blaze rods at their enemies to set them on fire. If a blaze runt is on water, it will swim. If a blaze runt that participated in a village raid is stopped, they will run away from the village.
