A cow is a passive mob in Minecraft: Story Mode.


== Appearances ==
In "Assembly Required", Mabel launches cows from her Cow-A-Pult invention in Redstonia (determinant). This is also the same with Disco Mickey, as he uses cows for his Bovine Lava Disco. They can also be seen behind Sandy if you speak to her.
In "Order Up!", a cow appears in the Overworld beneath Sky City after Isa, Jesse, and Lukas (determinant) fall off.
In "Jailhouse Block", if Geoff is sheared, he becomes a cow.


== Trivia ==
In Minecraft: Story Mode, a cow, when engaged with water, will shake the water off similar to Wolves in vanilla Minecraft.
In Redstonia, several cows can be seen in a hot air balloon floating above the town; the hot air balloon itself is designed to resemble a cow.
