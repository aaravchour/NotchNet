Creeders are hostile mobs that appear in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. They are a hybrid of creepers and prison spiders, and they make their only appearance in "Jailhouse Block" as they are seen chasing Jesse's Gang.


== Behavior ==
Creeders have the ability to climb and leap like a spider and explode like a creeper. However, their explosions are more powerful than creepers as they are capable of destroying obsidian. They are also seen using their front pair of legs to try and grab Jesse before exploding.


== Appearance ==
Creeders are a hybrid mob of a creeper and a prison spider created by Romeo. Their upper body consists of a creeper with black skin and glowing red eyes and mouth, their lower section consists of six spindly legs that can oftentimes be used as front limbs. Near their feet are small red spots that glow red.


== Appearances ==
In "Jailhouse Block", they appear when Jesse and Petra/Jack attempt to escape the Sunshine Institute.
They are fought again towards the end of the episode along with other hostile mobs when Jesse, Petra, Jack, Radar, Nurm/Lluna, and Xara escape The Burrows.


== Sounds ==


== Trivia ==
Creeders are exclusive to Minecraft: Story Mode.
Unlike the other spider variants, the creeders only have six legs rather than eight.
Unlike normal creepers or charged creepers, the creeders are capable of exploding obsidian.
This makes creeders and the Wither Storm the only mobs in Minecraft: Story Mode that are capable of exploding obsidian.
Telltale Games hosted a poll on Twitter listing off four possible names for the mob, with Creeders winning by a small amount. This means that the name was confirmed by Telltale, yet more-so chosen by the fandom which voted at the time.
