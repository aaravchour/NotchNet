The Giant Magma Golem is a boss mob that appears in "Below the Bedrock". It is an iron golem variant, made up of magma and cobblestone, created by Romeo to stop Jesse's gang.


== Creation ==
Besides being created by Romeo, it is assumed it was built with magma blocks and a pumpkin as the other normal-sized magma golems were created that way.


== Behavior ==
The Giant Magma Golem is capable of spewing out fire at a close range. This fire is like blaze or ghast fireballs as its literal fire and no fireball is seen. It is also capable of slamming its arms down which can light up the area where it smashes it. Despite its large size, it is capable of quick and nimble jumps.


== Appearance ==
The Giant Magma Golem is a very large variant of the magma golem created as a result of the machine making it jamming, causing its creation and its immense size. It is entirely composed of cobblestone with various lava cracks seeping from its chest and limbs, with its hands and feet boiling with magma. Its eyes glow a lava red. 


== Appearances ==
In "Below the Bedrock", when Jesse, Petra, and Radar are trying to get to Fred's cabin, they go through gates, guarded by Val and Soup. Once inside, the trio has to pull three levers. Romeo's voice is then heard through a jukebox, starting the challenge. Waves of Magma Cubes and Magma Golems then come out. After defeating them, the Giant Magma Golem comes out of the ground, and Jesse needs to fight it while Petra and Radar both distract the golem.


== Sounds ==


== Death ==
Killed by

Jesse (Indirectly)
Water
When the Giant Magma Golem appears, Jesse has to set off pressure plates triggering a waterfall, and the waterfalls on its arms. Jesse uses an iron pickaxe to destroy its two arms, but the pickaxe breaks. With some leftover sand and gunpowder, Jesse is able to craft TNT. Jesse then places the TNT under the Golem's foot, and when the Golem steps on it, it explodes on the ground and floor, uncovering a pool of water. The golem then falls into the water and dies.


== Trivia ==
Due to its entire body being made of cobblestone, Jesse and the gang were able to mine down parts of the giant golem.
This also makes it the first mob (not counting the copper golem) to become a mineable non-moving object once interacted with certain elements, in this case, water, as it hardens into cobblestone.
