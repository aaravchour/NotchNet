Icy Ender Creepers are hostile mobs in Minecraft: Story Mode. They are a hybrid of enderman and creeper with a palate similar to that of a snow golem. They were created by Romeo, and are found in the Icy Palace of Despair. They make their only appearance in "Giant Consequences".


== Behavior ==
Icy ender creepers have the ability to teleport like an enderman and explode like a creeper.


== Appearance ==
Icy ender creepers are a hybrid mob of the creeper and enderman. Their bodies are white, almost like snow and possess a creeper-like face with blue eyes. Their mouths, unlike the enderman which have an exposed jaw, can extend into a long mouth as they screech. 


== Appearances ==
In "Giant Consequences", when Jesse's gang, Jack, and Lluna try to save Stella and Radar, they encounter Icy Ender Creepers and hold them off while they try to free Radar and determinately Stella.


== Sounds ==


== Trivia ==
When idle, their sounds are similar to creepers and when hostile, they scream like an enderman. The difference is the crackling ice sound which is added.
Icy Ender Creepers are exclusive to Minecraft: Story Mode.
Instead of purple particles given off by endermen, they emit snow particles.
