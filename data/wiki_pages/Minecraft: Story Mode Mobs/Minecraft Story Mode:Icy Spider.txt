Icy spiders are a cold and icy variant of the spider found exclusively in Minecraft: Story Mode. They first appeared in "Giant Consequences" blocking off Jesse's Gang and attacking them.


== Behavior ==
Like normal spiders, they jump at the player and can scale horizontal blocks.


== Appearance ==
Icy spiders are an icy variant of the spider created by Romeo to guard the Icy Palace of Despair and ward off any intruders. Their bodies are a pale snow white in color with off-white stripes on its legs and body. They possess ice blue glowing eyes and a glowing blue abdomen with its texture similar to the inside of a beacon.


== Appearances ==
In "Giant Consequences", icy spiders attack Jesse, Petra, Jack, and "Vos" when they find another puzzle on a bridge, and the icy spiders eventually knock "Vos" off the bridge. (Determinant)

== Trivia ==
Icy spiders are exclusive to Minecraft: Story Mode.
Said by Eric Stirpe, whatever mob in Romeo's Icy Palace of Despair was called "icy [mob name here]."
