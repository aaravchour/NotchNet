Llamas are neutral and tameable mobs that appear in Minecraft: Story Mode.


== Appearances ==
(See Lluna for a list of Lluna's appearances.)

In "Below the Bedrock", a Brown Llama appears in Romeoburg.
If Lluna was taken in Jailhouse Block, she and the Llama meet and both spit on Jesse.
If Nurm was taken instead, the player is given the choice to either greet the Llama or shoo it away.


== Trivia ==
In the Season 2 title screen, a Brown Llama can be seen in Beacontown.
Every llama that has appeared in the game is female.
