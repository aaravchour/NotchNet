Pigs are passive mobs found in both Minecraft and Minecraft: Story Mode. They drop raw pork chops.


== Episodes ==
Reuben, one of the game's main characters, is a pig, and appears in the first four episodes of Season 1. He was Jesse's best friend.
In "The Order of the Stone", a group of pigs can be seen in the forest when Jesse is searching for Reuben.
In "Order Up!", a group of pigs also appears on a field below Sky City, which reminds Jesse of Reuben.
In "Hero in Residence", Jesse can choose who (Esteban, Smushy Cutecheeks, or Lord von Thunderpork VI) will be the pig playing the part of "Reuben" on the float for the Founding Day.
In "Above and Beyond", the three said pigs appear in the title sequences before being forced to be killed. They later appear as porkchops at the porkchop stand.


== Trivia ==
Pigs in Minecraft: Story Mode have a subtle unique texture. Old Minecraft Pigs used to have flat faces, when they were updated to have protruding snouts the texture for the snouts changed. Story Mode Pigs have both the old snout texture and protruding snouts.
There are few named pigs in Minecraft Story Mode:
Reuben
Esteban
Smushy Cutecheeks
Lord von Thunderpork VI
