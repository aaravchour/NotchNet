Prismarine creepers were prismarine variants of the creeper that were supposed to appear in Minecraft: Story Mode. They were most likely meant to come from the Heckmouth in the episode "Hero in Residence". They were ultimately scrapped and replaced instead by charged creepers, possibly to tone down the difficulty.


== Appearance ==
Prismarine creepers are prismarine golem variants of the creeper. As their name implies, they are made of unique etches and shades of prismarine possessing unique patterns and lines, as seen by its front body. Like the soldiers and the colossi, they possess tentacle-beards too but have two tentacles instead of four. They lastly have red eyes, differing from the usual green.

== Trivia ==
Prismarine creepers and slimes are the only scrapped mobs known to still be in the game files.
Like the soldiers and the colossi, their design is taken inspiration for Cthulhu.
