Prison golems are a dark variant of the iron golem that appears only in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. They were created and acted as guards of the Sunshine Institute and as strong soldiers. They first appeared in "Jailhouse Block".


== Behavior ==
Unlike their original counterparts, prison golems are hostile unless commanded an order. This is seen when Jesse gives an order to a group of red prison golems which vary from jumping on slime blocks to staying still. Prison golems are also notable quite nimble as they are capable of high jumps despite their weight and running quite fast.


== Appearance ==
Prison golems are a prison variant of the iron golem created by Romeo. Two variants of them exist, one is purple, normally see throughout the Sunshine Institute, and red, seen patrolling Beacontown. Both variants share the same body style, where they possess dark, almost-netherite or obsidian colored bodies and intricate lines etched onto its hands, limbs, and joints. They both also have glowing accents seen on their torso, arms, legs, and forehead, and glowing eyes. Another unique trait they possess is two "bumps" on the sides of their heads that resemble earmuffs and a long ridge that resembles the front of a cap.


== Appearances ==
In "Jailhouse Block", several prison golems appear in the Sunshine Institute, the first one who appears is named Big Hank, who chases Jesse to the entrance of the Sunshine Institute, later when Jesse and Petra/Jack attempt to escape the institute for the first time, they are chased by a golem named Large Henry, and another unnamed golem, one of them then captures Jesse and Petra/Jack, the unnamed one brings the latter to the Mush Room, and Large Henry brings Jesse to The Warden's office. While Jesse is in The Warden's office, 2 golems appear when Jesse looks out the window, one of which is shown with Radar and Nurm, they appear physically for the last time when Large Henry takes Terry to the Zombie Mines.
Although it is not seen, a Prison Golem can be heard when Jesse, Jack, Petra, Radar, Xara, and Lluna/Nurm escape the Institute.
In "Above and Beyond", red variants of prison golems are first seen when Jesse, Jack, Petra, Radar/Binta, and Nurm/Lluna enter Beacontown and see Axel, Olivia, and Stella with Romeo in Jesse's form. They are then seen again patrolling throughout Beacontown, and Jesse may command them to do certain things. When Jesse attempts to get inside Romeo's tower in Beacontown, Jesse encounters a red prison golem and fights it. It then falls off the tower to its death.
