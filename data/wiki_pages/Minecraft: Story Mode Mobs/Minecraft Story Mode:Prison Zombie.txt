Prison zombies are a darkened and more ominous variant of the zombie found exclusively in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. They first appeared in "Jailhouse Block" chasing Jesse's Gang.


== Behavior ==
They seem to behave like normal zombies, approaching and attacking the player via melee.


== Appearance ==
Prison zombies are a prison variant of the zombie created by Romeo to wander the outer perimeters of the Sunshine Institute. They are different from normal zombies as they have red eyes, an exposed ribcage on their right chest, coal black skin, and torn orange inmate outfits.


== Appearances ==
In "Jailhouse Block", after Jesse and Petra/Jack reunite in the Sunshine Institute, they go into the Burrows, where they encounter prison zombies. Jack/Petra then get grabbed by a pair of them, and Jesse kills them with the help of Jack/Petra. Later after Jesse, Jack, Petra, Radar, Xara, and Lluna/Nurm escape the Sunshine Institute, they encounter more prison zombies in the Burrows as well as other mobs, such as prison spiders and creeders.


== Trivia ==
Said by Eric Stirpe, most mobs in the Sunshine Institute was called "prison [mob name here]."
