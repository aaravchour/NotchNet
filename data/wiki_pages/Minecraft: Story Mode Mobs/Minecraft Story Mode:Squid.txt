Squids are passive mobs that appeared in both Season 1 and 2, normally seen underwater, swimming about.


== Behavior ==
Like their base game counterparts, they normally just swim about squirting ink when threatened.


== Appearance ==
Squids in Story Mode look similar to their base counterparts with a few texture differences, such as a glossier shine on their skin and their ability to move their pupils. Their pupils are also smaller.


== Appearances ==
In "The Order of the Stone", Jesse kills squids for ink sacs for his/her build at the EnderCon Building Competition.
Later, when Jesse and Petra fall off a bridge, there are squids swimming under them.
In "Assembly Required", when Jesse, Lukas, and Reuben are swimming to the other side to Soren's Fortress, squids can be seen swimming under them. They are, however, difficult to see.
In "Access Denied", a squid is seen on top of Jesse's head as he/she runs out of an unknown Portal.


== Trivia ==
The squids in Episode 2 are hard to spot due to their textures and the dark atmosphere. Though if one looks closely, he/she will be able to locate them.
