Wolves are passive mobs found in Minecraft: Story Mode: Season 2.


== Behavior ==
Adult wolves are not seen in Minecraft Story Mode. Baby Wolves, referred to "puppies" by in-game characters, act hyper and playful.


== Appearances ==
In "Hero in Residence", a puppy named Wink, owned by Stacy Plays, playfully chases Jesse before being fed a bone.
Later, Stella sells wolf pups at Champion City.
In "Below the Bedrock", a puppy named Blocco playfully chases Jesse before being fed a bone in Fred's Keep (Determinant).
In "Above and Beyond", Wink can be seen in Beacontown.


== Trivia ==
Despite already being tamed, Wink is fed a bone. In vanilla Minecraft, Tamed Wolves can't be fed bones.
In vanilla Minecraft, untamed wolves will attack rabbits and Sheep without being provoked, but will run away from llamas. This is not shown in Story Mode.
Despite being neutral mobs in Minecraft, they are passive creatures in Minecraft: Story Mode.
