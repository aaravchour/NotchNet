For the Elixir in Education Edition, See Medicine

The Elixir is a potion briefly seen in Minecraft Story Mode that was originally created by Ivor to stop the wither storm.


== Appearances ==
In "The Order of the Stone", the elixir is stolen by Jesse/Axel and is later thrown to the wither storm to stop it. However, the Wither Storm protects the command block in time, and it does not work.


== Trivia ==
When Jesse and Axel first discover the elixir, Axel claims that he had dreamt of it.
The elixir doesn't work unless the command block is exposed on the wither storm, but even if clicked/touched/pressed in time, the wither storm manages to protect itself quickly enough.
Despite looking like a drinkable potion, the elixir is a throw-able potion.
