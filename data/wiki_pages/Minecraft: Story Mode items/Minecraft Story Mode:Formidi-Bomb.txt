The formidi-bomb, also referred to as the "F-bomb", is a powerful explosive from Episode 3 of Season One.


== Crafting ==
Formidi-bomb is crafted with 8 gunpowder and a super TNT. According to Soren, attempting to craft it is very dangerous, as the ingredients are highly unstable when put together.


== Appearance ==
The formidi-bomb resembles normal TNT on the top, and like a command block from the sides. One side contains the letter "F". The bomb also has the white glow from the inside. It is also notably bigger than normal blocks.


== Usage ==
The explosive power of formidi-bomb is capable of temporary disabling the wither storm. It is, however, incapable of destroying command blocks. After using the bomb on wither storm, it has split into three, not before releasing the survivors that were sucked into it.


== Trivia ==
"Formidi-" is short for "formidable", which means difficult to deal with or overcome.
Magnus and Axel call the Formidi-Bomb the "F-Bomb", a joke about the f-word.
The Formidi-Bomb consumes the crafting table that is used to create it.
Unlike TNT, once the F-Bomb is crafted, it explodes in around 10 seconds.
It is unknown how Soren knows this, as it is clearly stated in Episode 4 that no one has crafted the bomb before Jesse.
Its explosion radius is high enough to destroy obsidian, so it must be higher than 6,000, but lower than 18,000,000.
