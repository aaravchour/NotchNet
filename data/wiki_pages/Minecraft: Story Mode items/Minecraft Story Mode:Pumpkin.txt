== White Pumpkin ==


=== Appearances ===
In "A Portal to Mystery", Cassie Rose's disguise includes a white pumpkin. Jesse retrieves one after finding Lukas wearing it because of getting framed.
There's a farm of white pumpkins in Cassie's lair.
In "Access Denied", Jesse can determinately use a white pumpkin to help escape the Hostile Mobs. This fails and results in Jesse being caught and made "useful".
In "A Journey's End?", Jesse has the choice to show a white pumpkin to The Old Builders, who are reminded of Cassie. In the end of the episode, Jesse places the white pumpkin on a pedestal in the Order Hall where it now resides.
In "Hero in Residence", the white pumpkin can be seen on display in the Order Hall.


== White Jack o'Lantern ==

The White Jack o'Lantern's texture is actually blue to represent the darkness of the area and so it doesn't become confused with the White Pumpkin. The whole block glows and it's face is a pink color. This suggests it contains a redstone torch or that the inside is pink. These replace redstone lamps hanging from the ceiling after the lights go out.


== White Pumpkin Stem ==

The White Pumpkin Stem is similar to a regular one. It's notably white and grows white pumpkins.


== Trivia ==
In "Order Up!", Jesse will always find a pumpkin inside the Temple of the Old Builders regardless of which chest he/she chooses to open.
Cassie's White Pumpkin also has a voice changer making her voice deeper.
When wearing a White Pumpkin in Episode 7, it won't give Jesse a deeper voice, and it will have no yellow eyes as it was damaged in the sword fight with Cassie Rose.
