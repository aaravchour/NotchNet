The redstone heart is a special power source exclusive to Minecraft: Story Mode that first appeared in "Access Denied". 


== Appearance ==
The redstone heart appears to be mostly red, as created with redstone dust. It also has a pink and white symbol at each side, shaped like a four-petaled flower.


== Usage ==
The redstone heart is a powerful energy source which can be used to power anything similar to a battery. It was used by Harper to create PAMA, then by Jesse to reveal the stairs to the Atlas.


== Trivia ==
The redstone heart is similar in appearance to the nether reactor core when activated, except that it has a pattern similar to a redstone lamp.
Because the transmigrational headset was based something from the April Fools Trendy Update, it is possible that the redstone heart was also based on the USB charger block from said update.
If Jesse looks at a book in Harper's Secret Laboratory, they will find the third book by Soren with the same name as "The Redstone Heart."
The redstone heart appears to pulse with light, resembling the beating of a real heart.
The redstone heart beats slower when it was disconnected from PAMA.
In Episode 8, Hadrian reveals that the Redstone Heart used to be in possession of The Old Builders. One day Harper left and took the redstone heart with her.
