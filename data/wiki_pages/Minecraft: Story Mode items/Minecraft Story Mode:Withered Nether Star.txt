The Withered Nether Star, also known as the Wither Storm Nether Star, is an item found in Minecraft: Story Mode. It was dropped by the Wither Storm and first appears in "A Block and a Hard Place".


== Appearance ==
The Withered Nether Star looks similar to that of a regular Nether Star, but is instead colored purplish-black to match the Wither Storm's color scheme. A regular Nether Star also exists in Minecraft: Story Mode, but, unlike its Withered Nether Star counterpart, it is not attributed to the defeat of the Wither Storm; rather, it is connected to the defeat of a normal Wither.


== Usage ==
The Withered Nether Star is much more powerful than a regular Nether Star. It has the power to power at least nine beacons. This is shown when Jessie places it in the center of Beacontown's beacon.


== Trivia ==
In Episode 5, a normal Nether Star can also be seen on display inside the Order Hall.
Though there are beacons are already placed on the pyramid in the center of Beacontown, they do not activate until the Withered Nether Star is placed in the center.
The Nether Star is then removed as it is seen in the Order Hall in the episode "Order Up!". The Beacons seem unaffected by it's absence.
The Corrupted Beacon from Minecraft Dungeons may have taken inspiration from this.
