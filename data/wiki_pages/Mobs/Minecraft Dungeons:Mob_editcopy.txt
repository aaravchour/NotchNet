A mob is an AI-driven game entity resembling a living creature. The term "mob" is short for "mobile entity". There are several mobs exclusively found in Minecraft Dungeons that are not present in the base game, Minecraft. The mobs in Minecraft Dungeons are mainly divided into two categories - Enemies and Friendlies.

== Trivia ==
The sound files or behavior animations are known as "Novelty".
If a hero's enchantment is used by a mob, some of that enchantment's effects turn it purple (examples are Fire Trail and Poison Cloud).
If any mob is 32 blocks away from the hero, its animation stops to prevent the game from crashing.
Unlike the original game, the value of mob damage depends on mob data instead of weapon data. The ranged and melee weapons used by mobs are only a part of render and decoration, and does not cause additional damage to mobs and heroes. For example, axes held by vindicators are renders. Ladles used by vindicator chefs are skins of axes instead of unique items.
Bows and crossbows used by mobs do not have any animation when used. However, a hero's bow has a bowstring animation, although there is no arrow on the bowstring when the bow is drawn. (Not include Minecraft Dungeons Arcade.)
Most mobs have default animation or "Get Hit" animations in game files, However some of their legs position or whole animation is unused in game, or used in Minecraft Dungeons Arcade only.
