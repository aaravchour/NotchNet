A mob is an AI-driven game entity resembling a living creature. Besides its common meaning, the term "mob" is short for "mobile entity". All mobs can be attacked and hurt (from falling, attacked by a player or another mob, falling into the void, hit by an arrow, etc), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and drop good or bad loot depending on the mob that was killed.


== Spawning ==

Mobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level, biome, and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it is a cave, dungeon, mansion, or at night). Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player. Some mobs including passive and neutral animals, and even hoglins have the ability to be bred by the player, creating offspring. Villagers also breed randomly depending on the time of day and the number of beds (though they can’t be directly bred by the player). Most mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other aquatic creatures), in lava (except for striders), on bedrock, or on blocks less than a full block tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners, from which monsters can spawn naturally on any block including air.
Some mobs (like the snow golem and the wither) require that the player "construct" them before being able to spawn. The iron golem can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with four end crystals.
Players can also spawn mobs easily by using a spawn eggs in Creative mode, or the /summon command. 


=== Despawning ===

Many mobs despawn (cease to exist) after a certain amount of time if far enough from the player. In Java Edition, most passive mobs do not despawn, while most monsters do. In Bedrock Edition, almost all mobs despawn.


== Behavior ==

Mobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to physics, and they can be hurt by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning, attacked by weapons, /kill command, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as some Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders. When mobs are killed, they turn to dust and drop items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt, while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close. Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within 16 blocks of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks (spherical) away. Mobs are harmless to players in Creative mode.
Most mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as ice, glass, tall grass, glass panes or copper grates. In Java Edition, mobs (except wardens) do not attempt to walk over rails tracks unless pushed onto the rails by other mobs.‌


== List of mobs ==
Mobs are listed and classified by their nature from the player's perspective. For more details on a particular mob, click on them to view their individual page.


=== Passive mobs ===
Passive mobs are harmless mobs (except for the pufferfish) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked. Most of them can be bred or tamed.


=== Neutral mobs ===
Neutral mobs are sometimes passive and sometimes hostile toward the player. All of these mobs (except goats and foxes) are provoked when the player attacks it first. Some mobs may also be naturally hostile with provocation, and some mobs also have some additional way to be provoked.


=== Hostile mobs ===
Hostile mobs are dangerous, aggressive mobs that always attack the player within their respective detection ranges.


=== Compound mobs ===
Compound mobs, also called jockeys, are a special condition in which a mob spawns riding another mob. All jockeys are hostile except for the strider jockey, which is neutral.


=== Unused mobs ===

Only contains a few mobs that never spawn naturally in-game as they can only be summoned with the /summon command though the zombie horse, Agent and NPC can be spawned in with a spawn egg.


=== Removed mobs ===

Removed mobs no longer exist in current versions of the game.


=== Joke mobs ===

Mobs that were added as a joke for April Fools' Day in Java Edition.


=== Unimplemented mobs ===

Mobs that were announced by Mojang as potential additions to the game, but either got scrapped or shelved indefinitely.


=== Upcoming (new) mobs ===
Mobs that are announced by Mojang to be added in the upcoming update.


== Classification ==
Most of the mobs are divided into different types, which can determine certain attributes of the mob, such as their behaviors and how other mobs behave around them.


=== Basic categories ===
Most mobs are either classified as animals or monsters. Animals are mobs who are based on real-life animals, and usually have some way of interacting with players, such as being bred, tamed, or captured. Monsters are mobs that are generally pursued by iron golems and prevent players from sleeping.


=== Specific mob groups ===
Some mobs are assigned to a more detailed group. There are a total of four mob classifications that have different effects than other mobs. These mobs have certain weaknesses and immunities as a result of what group they fall into.


==== Undead mobs ====

This group of mobs includes drowned, husks, phantoms, skeletons, skeleton horses, strays, withers, wither skeletons, zoglins, zombies, zombie horses, zombie villagers, and zombified piglins. These mobs are damaged by potions of Healing, healed by potions of Harming, and are immune to drowning (except for husks and zombies, which turn into zombies and drowned if drowning, respectively) and Poison damage. Zombies, zombie villagers, drowned, skeletons, strays, and phantoms burn when under direct sunlight, unless they are touching water or wearing a helmet. Under the fire resistance effect, undead mobs still catch fire in direct sunlight but do not get hurt by the fire. All undead mobs except for drowned, phantoms, and withers sink in water. All undead mobs take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite, and are ignored by withers.
Most undead mobs have the ability to pick up items. Some can spawn wearing armor, or holding tools or weapons.


==== Aquatic mobs ====

This group of mobs includes axolotls, dolphins, squids, glow squids, guardians, elder guardians, turtles, cod, salmon, pufferfish, and tropical fish, but not drowned. They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with Impaling‌‌, and, except axolotl, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long. Aquatic mobs have the ability to swim, whereas other mobs simply float on water or sink.
In Bedrock Edition there is no internal classification for these mobs, with their only shared trait being weakness to Impaling, which applies to all mobs, including drowned, when in contact with water.


==== Arthropods ====

This group consists of mobs based on arthropods, namely bees, cave spiders, endermites, silverfish, and spiders. They take extra damage and receive the Slowness IV effect when attacked with weapons enchanted with Bane of Arthropods.


==== Illagers ====

This group includes pillagers, illusioners‌, ravagers‌, evokers, and vindicators. They are immune to evoker fangs damage and ignored by vindicators named "Johnny" (except ravagers‌). They are hostile toward villagers, wandering traders, iron golems and players in Survival or Adventure mode. Witches, and vexes may accompany them in raids. Illusioners (unused) and witches‌ can see players or targets through blocks.


=== Boss mobs ===
Boss mobs are special hostile mobs that are distinctly more dangerous and tougher than other mobs. They do not spawn randomly, and are confronted intentionally. Boss mobs provide unique challenges but also equivalent rewards. Unlike mob categories, the status of a boss is not recognized in-game, and no specific characteristic determines a boss mob. Instead, the label is assigned to certain mobs by various Mojang sources. Named boss mobs include:

Elder Guardian
Ender Dragon
Ravager
Wither

== Mob vote ==

In 2016, Jeb held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama to Minecraft over the alpaca. In the six annual Minecraft events MINECON Earth 2017, MINECON Earth 2018, MINECON Live 2019, Minecraft Live 2020, Minecraft Live 2021, Minecraft Live 2022, and Minecraft Live 2023, the public also voted on a mob to be added to Minecraft. In the first vote, the winner was the phantom (then known as "Mob B" or "The Monster of the Night Skies"). In the second, the winner was the taiga biome and the fox. In the third, the winner was the mountain biome and the goat. In the fourth, the winner was the glow squid. In the fifth, the winner was the allay. In the sixth, the winner was the sniffer. And In the seventh, the winner was the armadillo. Shortly before the second vote, the China Edition also had a mob vote, the winner of which was the panda. Shortly after the second vote, there was also a vote for which new cat skin would be added, the winner of which was Jellie. The mob vote was discontinued in 2024.

== Issues ==
For issues unique to specific mobs, see that mob's issues section.
Issues relating to "Mob" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.


== Trivia ==
Renaming a mob "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" using a spawn egg or name tag causes it to flip upside down.
Renaming a sheep "jeb_" makes its wool change color with a smooth transition between colors. Note that the sheep named "jeb_" drops only the color of wool it had when named (e.g., when a pink sheep is named "jeb_" and then sheared when its color has changed to blue, it still drops pink wool).
Renaming a vindicator "Johnny" makes it attack all nearby mobs, except other illagers.
Renaming a rabbit "Toast" gives the rabbit a new texture, as an Easter egg to xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit.
Spiders, cave spiders, slimes, silverfish and illusioners are some of the few mobs that can see players behind walls.
Cats, villagers and bats can see players with the invisibility effect.
There are many blocks in the game that do not take up a full block, such as trapdoors, and mobs actually see many of these as full blocks.
With some blocks, mobs mistake them for air, such as carpets, snow, and string.
Strangely, despite the term mob being derived from mobile entity, supplementary material consistently uses it within the Minecraft universe. Characters from Minecraft Story Mode begin calling monsters mobs starting in Order Up, whereas Farnum refers to himself as a “mobologist.”
