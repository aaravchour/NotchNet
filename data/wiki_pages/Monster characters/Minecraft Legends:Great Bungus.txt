== Biography ==
Originally, Bungus was just another piglin brute in the litter, described by Kritten as a brutish bully. However, using Kritten’s aid they rose up the ranks of a large bastion led by the Great Grungert, before declaring themselves the new ruler. Initially they were said to be quite grateful and generous to Kritten, valuing their insight like no one else, but over time let the control get to them. By the time we meet them, Kritten was just another face in a room to Bungus, treating them with regular verbal abuse and negligence.
