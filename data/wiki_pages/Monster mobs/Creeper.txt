A creeper is a common hostile mob that silently approaches players and then explodes, which can destroy blocks and kill unarmored players on any difficulty (except for peaceful).
When struck by lightning, a creeper becomes a charged creeper, which amplifies its explosion power and enables mob heads to be obtained from piglins, zombies, skeletons, and other creepers it kills.
Due to its distinctive appearance and unique and destructive method of attack, the creeper has become one of the most iconic mobs of Minecraft, being featured in promotional material and merchandise.


== Spawning ==
Creepers naturally spawn in the Overworld on solid blocks with a light level of 0, except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes. They spawn individually in Bedrock Edition and in groups of up to four in Java Edition.
In Bedrock Edition, there is a density limit of five creepers in the Overworld's surface.


== Drops ==
When killed, creepers drop:

5 experience points, if killed by the player or a tamed wolf.
0–2 gunpowder. The maximum amount is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 with Looting III.
1 music disc at random (from 13, cat, blocks, chirp, far, mall, mellohi, stal, strad, ward, 11, and wait), if killed by a skeleton, stray, bogged, or on Java Edition wither skeleton.


== Behavior ==

Creepers chase any player within a 16-block radius. They do not attack any other mob without provocation by being attacked first.
When within 3 blocks of a player, a creeper stops moving, hisses(which almost sounds like a balloon inflating), flashes and expands, and explodes after 1.5 seconds, destroying blocks in the area as well as significantly damaging the player. A creeper's detonation can be halted if the player leaves the blast radius, including by knocking it back, going out of the creeper's sight, or if the creeper is killed before the explosion. The distance with the player at which a creeper cancels its explosion is greater at higher difficulties. Normal creeper explosions have a power of 3.
A creeper explodes only if it has an uninterrupted line of sight with the player throughout the entire 1.5-second countdown. As a result, if the creeper does not have line-of-sight with the player, it does not start hissing even at close range, even if the player is attacking it, and a detonation is canceled if it has started. The hissing sound plays in its entirety regardless of whether the explosion happens or not.
Unlike most mobs, the creeper doesn't have an idle sound, nor does it have unique step sounds. Although it does make normal stepping and swimming sounds, it is hard for players to distinguish those from sounds they make themselves. This makes the approach of a creeper difficult for an unwary player to notice until it starts hissing. 
A creeper jumps down to a player if it can survive the fall. Creepers begin the 1.5-second countdown before falling, so an explosion occurs sooner after landing with higher falls.
Creepers can climb up ladders, vines, and similar blocks like any other mob, but do not do so intentionally. 
Using a flint and steel or fire charge‌ on a creeper forces an explosion.
The detection range of creepers is reduced by 50% when the player is wearing a creeper head.‌
Creepers flee from ocelots and cats within a 6-block radius, with faster movement than when pursuing a player. Cats and ocelots do not attack creepers. A creeper that has begun a detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. 
Creepers are not targeted by tamed wolves, iron golems or zoglins. However, they are still attacked by withers, snow golems, vindicators named "Johnny", wardens and goats. When hit by a stray projectile (like a drowned's trident), a creeper retaliates if not already chasing a player, unless said projectile is a skeleton's arrow. When attacked by a goat, or poisoned by a pufferfish, a creeper does not retaliate. If a creeper is attacked by any other mob, the creeper moves toward the mob that attacked it and explodes.
When a creeper is inflicted with a status effect, its explosion creates an area effect cloud of the effect.‌  


=== Charged creeper ===

A charged creeper has a significantly increased explosion power.
A charged creeper is created only when lightning strikes within four blocks of a normal creeper. The lightning can be created in any way, including naturally, with the /summon command, by a trident with the Channeling enchantment, or attracted to a lightning rod. Charged creepers are distinguished from normal creepers by the blue aura surrounding them.
In Java Edition, a charged creeper can be summoned with the following command: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {powered:1}
In Bedrock Edition, a charged creeper can be summoned by: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ minecraft:become_charged
Their countdown timers are the same as normal creepers, both in terms of range and time. With a power of 6, an explosion caused by a charged creeper is twice as powerful as the explosion caused by a creeper. Charged creepers' explosions are 50% more powerful than an explosion of TNT. How close the creeper was to the lightning strike does not affect the size or power of the explosion.
Charged creepers have the same entity ID as normal creepers. The only difference is that the value of the boolean powered tag is set to 1 (true).
In Java Edition, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, piglins, or other creepers causes one of those mobs to drop its corresponding mob head. If multiple valid mobs are killed in the explosion, the one that drops a head is chosen at random. In Bedrock Edition, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, or other creepers causes all the killed mobs to drop their corresponding heads.
A charged creeper does not drop its own head when it explodes, although any other charged creepers or creepers killed in the explosion drop a creeper head. Players and ender dragons do not drop their heads, nor do mobs without corresponding mob heads, such as livestock animals.


=== Disable creeper explosions ===
                                                                           
To disable creeper explosions while still allowing mob griefing (e.g. for villager farms), run the following command: /execute as @e[type=creeper,tag=!noexplode] run data merge entity @s {ExplosionRadius:0,Tags:[noexplode]}

== Trivia ==

Besides Steve and the removed mob, the creeper is the oldest mob in Minecraft.
Notch has stated on that "I imagine creepers as being made out of leaves or similar. I'm not sure why they explode." When asked to describe its physical texture, he said they would feel "crunchy, like dry leaves.".
This can also be interpreted from the fact that the original texture for creepers is the same as an old texture of leaves.
Creepers are bright green color to camouflage them for the original classic Minecraft foliage textures, which were bright shades of green, but has since been changed.
In multiplayer, if a creeper is attacked by another player, and the other player runs out of sight, it does not attack any other players.
When asked how creepers trigger their explosive nature, Dinnerbone said "They're so nervous that they shake a lot, and then this sets them off the same way as how rubbing two sticks makes fire".
If a charged creeper is given Invisibility, the "aura" effect is still visible.
A charged creeper explosion can inflict the greatest amount of damage any mob in the game can do at one time.
The creeper hiss sound uses the same sound file as when a block of TNT is primed but played at a lower pitch.
In A Minecraft Movie, Creepers are visibly shown to have a grassy, leafy green skin. However, when they swell up to explode, they are shown to be quite hollow on the inside.


=== Publicity ===
Creepers have a formidable reputation in the community because of their potential to hurt or kill even veteran players and destroy structures. Their distinct appearance and destructive abilities have made them a widely recognizable Minecraft icon. Creepers are referenced in several of the items available at the Minecraft merchandise depot, and have become an internet meme complete with fan art, webcomic references, and demotivational posters. A central part of the meme is the creeper's unofficial catchphrase derived from the mob's tendency to sneak up on the player and hiss before detonating:
"That'sssss a very nice <random valuable object> you've got there... It'd be a ssssshame if anything were to happen to it..."
Moe Szyslak took the appearance of a creeper and exploded in the Simpsons’ home within the 17th episode of season 25.
In Captain Sparklez's music video "Revenge", where a player is chased by and fights creepers, the main viral lyric "Creeper? Aww, man!" became an iconic meme and quote over the years.
