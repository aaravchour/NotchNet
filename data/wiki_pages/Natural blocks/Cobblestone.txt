Cobblestone is a common block, obtained from mining stone. It is mainly used for crafting or as a building block.


== Obtaining ==
Cobblestone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Its hardness is greater than stone so it requires more time to break, especially with anything other than a pickaxe.

Cobblestone is dropped by stone when mined without Silk Touch, and also by infested cobblestone when mined with Silk Touch. 


=== Natural generation ===
Cobblestone occurs naturally in monster rooms, jungle pyramids, pillager outposts, ocean ruins, strongholds, plains, taiga and snowy plains villages, woodland mansions, and trail ruins.
In Java Edition, a single block of cobblestone always generates at the coordinates of (8, -61, 8) at the center of the void start platform, in Superflat worlds created with the Void biome preset.


=== Post-generation ===

When water and flowing lava come into contact, the flowing lava is replaced by cobblestone; this is how cobblestone can be generated renewablely. However, if the lava flows on top of the water from above, stone is created instead. Non-flowing lava (a lava source block) turns into obsidian upon contact with water, thus the requirement of flowing lava.


== Usage ==
Cobblestone can be used as basic building block, as it is blast resistant and extremely common.


=== Silverfish ===
Silverfish can enter and hide in cobblestone, creating an infested block.
