=== Natural generation ===

Granite can generate in the Overworld in the form of ores. 
In Bedrock Edition, granite attempts to generate in two batches in all biomes in the Overworld. The first batch generate 2 times per chunk in ores of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60. The second batch has 1⁄6 chance to generate ores of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. In Bedrock Edition, granite can replace stone, andesite, diorite, polished andesite‌, polished diorite‌, polished granite‌. In Java Edition, granite can replace stone, andesite, diorite, tuff, and deepslate.
In addition, granite generates as part of large copper ore veins, coral reefs‌, and in desert village armorer houses. Polished granite generates in many ocean ruin variants.

Granite can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

=== Trading ===
Journeyman-level stone mason villagers have a 2⁄7 chance to sell 4 polished granite for one emerald as part of their trades.

== Trivia ==
Granite rock comes from underground magma chambers that turned cold. It's often pinkish in color because of its alkali feldspar minerals.
Diorite is another magma chamber rock, but it has less quartz in it than granite. This is in accordance with granite's crafting recipe in Minecraft, which consists of nether quartz with diorite.
