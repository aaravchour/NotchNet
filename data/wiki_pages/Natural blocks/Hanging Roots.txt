Hanging roots are a natural decorative block found underground in the lush caves biome.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Hanging roots can be destroyed with any tool or by hand instantly, but can only be collected using shears. In Bedrock Edition, any Silk Touch tool also works.


=== Natural generation ===
Hanging roots can generate inside a lush cave beneath an azalea tree on the surface above.


=== Post-generation ===
Using bone meal on rooted dirt causes hanging roots to grow below the block.
Hanging roots may be obtained by using a hoe on rooted dirt, transforming the rooted dirt into normal dirt in the process.


== Usage ==
They can only be placed on the underside of a block.


=== Composting ===
Placing hanging roots into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
