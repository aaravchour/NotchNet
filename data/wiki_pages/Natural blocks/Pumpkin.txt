A pumpkin is a fruit block that appears in patches in grassy biomes. Pumpkins have the same texture on all 4 sides.
A carved pumpkin is a carved version of a pumpkin that can be worn or used to spawn golems. It can be made by using shears on a pumpkin placed in the world.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===
Pumpkin
Pumpkins naturally generate with the terrain in most biomes in the Overworld, in the form of random patches. They require only grass blocks with air above (clear of any plants such as flowers or grass), and can generate regardless whether that grass block has a layer of snow cover. Practically speaking, this means that the occurrence of pumpkins in stony or sandy biomes, or in grassy biomes with few clear grass blocks, is comparatively rare. Each chunk has a 1⁄32 chance to generate a pumpkin patch, making naturally-generated pumpkins rarer than diamond ore. 
Pumpkins naturally generate in stem farm rooms in woodland mansions.
4 pumpkins generate naturally in woolen tents in pillager outposts.
Pumpkins generate naturally as pile (and in some farms) in taiga and snowy taiga‌ villages.

Carved pumpkin
Carved pumpkins generate in rail rooms in woodland mansions, as well as in pillager outposts as a part of scarecrows.


=== Breaking ===
Pumpkins can be mined using any tool, but axes are the quickest way.

When a pumpkin and a carved pumpkin is pushed by a piston, it breaks and drops as an item. It cannot be pulled.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Mob loot ===
The carved pumpkin of a snow golem can be obtained by shearing its head, revealing the golem's face. The carved pumpkin cannot be put back on the golem.


=== Trading ===
Wandering traders can sell a pumpkin for one emerald.


=== Post-generation ===
A carved pumpkin (and 4 pumpkin seeds) is obtained by using shears on an uncarved pumpkin. Once carved, a pumpkin cannot be changed back to uncarved. This changes the rotation of the top texture.


== Usage ==
When placed, a carved pumpkin automatically faces the player.


=== Farming ===

Pumpkin farming strategies parallel those of melons. Planted pumpkin seeds grow a central stem that, after maturing, generates pumpkins randomly on adjacent vacant dirt-based blocks (dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots). If a pumpkin is harvested without also cutting the central stalk, another pumpkin generates afterward without requiring replanting or waiting for the stalk to mature again. If a carved pumpkin is desired, simply use the shears on the pumpkin on the ground, and then harvest it as normal.
Pumpkin stems take around 10 to 30 minutes to fully develop. They require a light level of 9 or higher to grow. Bone meal can be used on pumpkin stems to become fully-grown, but this does not produce a pumpkin immediately.


=== Helmet ===

A carved pumpkin can be equipped as a helmet without any actual armor value. When worn, it limits the player's viewing area to a mask pattern that resembles the pumpkin's carved face. The pattern does not appear when using the third-person view (toggled by F5 by default). It also doesn't appear when the heads-up display is disabled by pressing F1.‌
A player wearing a carved pumpkin does not aggravate endermen when looking at them. When wearing a carved pumpkin, creaking will still walk towards and attack the player even when looking at them.


=== Dispensers ===
Dispensers can equip a carved pumpkin on a player, mob or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing. It can also place the carved pumpkin as a block, if a snow or iron golem can be spawned after the pumpkin is placed.


=== Building golems ===

Carved pumpkins can be used to make snow golems, iron golems and copper golems as shown below. Snow golems require snow blocks for their bodies; iron golems require iron blocks; and copper golems require a single copper block for their bodies and a copper chest. The carved pumpkin must be placed last, or the golem does not spawn. The orientation of the carved pumpkin does not matter while building an iron golem or snow golem.


=== Crafting ingredient ===


=== Trading ===
Apprentice-level Farmer villagers buy 6 pumpkins for an emerald as part of their trades.‌
Apprentice-level Farmer villagers have a 2⁄3 chance to buy 6 pumpkins for one emerald.‌


=== Enchantments ===
Carved Pumpkins can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil.


=== Composting ===
Placing a pumpkin or carved pumpkin into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.


=== Note blocks ===
Pumpkin can be placed under note blocks to produce didgeridoo sounds. This doesn't apply to carved pumpkins.

== Trivia ==
The carved pumpkin is the only headgear that obstructs the player's view.
A carved pumpkin enchanted with Curse of Binding cannot be removed from a player's helmet slot unless the player dies, since it does not lose durability like armor does.
In Hardcore mode‌, such a carved pumpkin effectively stays on the player forever.
