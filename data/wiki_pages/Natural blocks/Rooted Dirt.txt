Rooted dirt is a natural decorative block.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===

Rooted dirt can generate under azalea trees. Below the first block directly underneath the trunk, rooted dirt randomly replaces blocks in a 5×5 cross-section centered on the tree until it reaches the lush caves biome.


=== Post-generation ===
Single rooted dirt replaces dirt, coarse dirt or moss below oak logs where azalea trees are grown from azalea or flowering azalea.


=== Breaking ===
Rooted dirt can be mined using any tool or without a tool.


=== Trading ===
Wandering traders can sell 2 rooted dirt for 1 emerald.


=== Mob loot ===
An enderman holding rooted dirt drops the block upon death.


== Usage ==
Much like coarse dirt, neither mycelium nor grass can spread onto rooted dirt. 
While it yields itself when dug, it does not convert into dirt after a block is placed onto it.
Rooted dirt blocks can be converted into dirt path blocks by using any type of shovel on the side or top of rooted dirt with air above it.


=== Hanging roots ===
Using bone meal on rooted dirt causes hanging roots to grow below the block, if space is available for it to grow.
Using a hoe on rooted dirt turns it into normal dirt and drops a hanging roots item.


=== Mud ===
Using a water bottle, splash water bottle or lingering water bottle will convert the rooted dirt into mud.


== Sounds ==

Its sound is between that of wooden planks and dirt variants.
