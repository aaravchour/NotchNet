Sculk is a bioluminescent block found abundantly in the deep dark or converted from other blocks by a sculk catalyst. Like most of the rest of the sculk family it drops experience when broken by a tool that is not enchanted with Silk Touch.

=== Breaking ===
Sculk blocks can be mined with any tool, but hoes are the quickest. It always drops 1 experience if mined without Silk Touch.


=== Natural generation ===
Sculk are naturally generated in patch formations within the deep dark biome.


=== Post-generation ===
Sculk blocks generate when a mob dies within 8 blocks of a sculk catalyst, replacing blocks in the area with the sculk_replaceable tag, which includes the surface materials of most biomes in all three dimensions.


== Usage ==
Sculk blocks are primarily used for decoration. They have an animated texture that consists of glowing spots, but they do not illuminate the surroundings. It has a similar texture of an end portal viewed from above.
Sculk blocks near sculk catalyst are also used for sculk growth, which can produce more sculk blocks, sculk sensors and sculk shriekers.

== Trivia ==
"Sculk" is derived from the word "skulk," meaning "keep out of sight, typically with a sinister or cowardly motive".
During the prototype phase, sculk was much easier to trigger; simply stepping on in would make a lot of noise and attract the Warden. This ended up being deemed unfair, resulting in the creation of the Sculk Sensor.
The old trypophobia shrieker was a combination of the modern day shrieker and scrapped sculk jaw as it would both scream and show teeth
