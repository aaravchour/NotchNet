Shroomlights are light-emitting blocks that generate in huge fungi.


== Obtaining ==
Shroomlight blocks can be broken using any tool, but a hoe is the fastest. They always drop themselves as an item


=== Post-generation ===
Both crimson and warped huge fungi can generate shroomlights near their tops. This includes both naturally generated huge fungi and huge fungi grown with bone meal.


== Usage ==


=== Light source ===
Shroomlights provide a light level of 15, the highest level in the game. Unlike Glowstone, Shroomlights also allows redstone signals to pass through them, as they are treated like a solid block. 


=== Composting ===
Placing a shroomlight into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level.
