The Nether wastes is the most common biome found in the Nether.


== Description ==
The Nether wastes is a barren, maroon-tinted biome composed of mostly netherrack. It has extensive lava seas with glowstone blobs hanging from the ceiling. Blobs of nether quartz, nether gold ore, and blackstone generate in the wastes (where ore is most visible) with the more rare Ancient Debris found unexposed within the terrain. Gravel and soul sand are found along its coastlines.
Most of the Nether’s residents can be found throughout the wasteland including: Ghasts, zombified piglins, magma cubes, striders, piglins and occasionally endermen. Nether fortresses and bastion remnants are present as well.

== Trivia ==
In Bedrock Edition,  if the Nether Wastes is used as the biome for Overworld generation, although the terrain is entirely netherrack, no ore is generated (including nether quartz, nether gold ore, ancient debris, etc.). Caverns and lakes (with red-colored water) still generate. The player is still able to place water in an Overworld Nether Wastes biome, but trying to sleep in a bed still causes an explosion.
