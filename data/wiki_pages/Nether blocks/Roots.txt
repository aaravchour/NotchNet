Roots are a non-solid "plant" block that come in two variants, crimson roots and warped roots, which generate naturally on warped or crimson nylium and soul soil in their respective biomes. They resemble a colony of tall, thin mushrooms.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Roots can be mined instantly using any tool. They drop themselves as items when broken. Flower pots containing roots drop both the flower pot and roots when broken.


=== Natural generation ===
Crimson roots generate in the crimson forest biome and rarely in the soul sand valley and warped forest biomes.
Warped roots generate in warped forest biomes.


=== Mob loot ===
An enderman holding crimson or warped roots drops the block upon death.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Post-generation ===
Applying bone meal to nylium causes roots to appear on that nylium block, and on nearby nylium. The generated roots are the same type as the nylium that the bone meal is used on. Using bone meal on warped nylium can also generate crimson roots at a very low chance.


== Usage ==


=== Decoration ===

Roots are decorative blocks. They can be planted on the same blocks that fungi can be placed on. Roots can be planted in a flower pot, which gives them a different texture.


=== Compost ===
Roots can also be used on a composter, with a 65% chance of increasing the level by 1.
