Soul soil is a block found abundantly in soul sand valleys. Unlike soul sand it does not slow down players or mobs that walk on it. 


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Soul soil drops as an item when broken with any tool or by hand, but a shovel is the fastest way to break it.
A soul campfire, when broken without using a Silk Touch tool, drops a block of soul soil. Since soul campfires can be crafted with renewable soul sand, this makes soul soil renewable as well.


=== Natural generation ===
Soul soil generates naturally in the soul sand valley biome.


== Usage ==
Unlike soul sand, soul soil does not slow mobs down, does not create bubble columns and does not allow items to fall through into a hopper.


=== Fire ===
Fire lit on soul soil becomes soul fire.


=== Withers ===

4 blocks of soul soil (or soul sand) are used in the construction of a wither.


=== Basalt ===
Lava on top of soul soil and directly adjacent to blue ice turns into basalt. Re-producing basalt this way can comprise a "basalt generator."
