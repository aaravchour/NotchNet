A blaze is a hostile mob that spawns in nether fortresses and is the only source of blaze rods. Blazes attack at range by firing a trio of fireballs or can attack the player that gets too close to them with their spinning rods.


== Spawning ==
Blazes may spawn naturally in nether fortresses in groups of 2 or 3 at a light level of 11 or less. Blazes spawn from monster spawners in nether fortresses. The spawners are located on small platforms with a three-block staircase leading up to it.


== Drops ==
A blaze may drop 1 blaze rod or from 0 to 4 with Looting III when killed by the player or tamed wolf.
10 experience orbs are dropped if killed by a player or tamed wolf.


== Behavior ==
Blazes are immune to damage from fire and lava, and fly, although when not attacking they stay on the ground or sink down slowly through the air. Blazes attempt to swim upward in lava or water. Blazes fall through lava and water when idle. Despite taking damage from water, blazes make no attempt to protect themselves if pushed or dropped into water. Their pathfinding does not avoid fire or lava‌ but does avoid water. They take 5 freezing damage from powder snow. Blazes are also hurt by snowballs, taking 3 damage per hit. It takes seven snowballs to kill a blaze. They are also damaged by splash water bottles, taking 1 damage per hit. Like endermen, blazes are also damaged by rain by 1 every half second.


=== Attacking ===

Blazes target players within 48 blocks. If a blaze is damaged by a player or other mob, it alerts other blazes within 48 blocks to target the attacker.‌ A blaze flies when it acquires a target, slowly approaching while attempting to remain from 0.5 to 3.5 blocks above the target.

A blaze's normal attack is a trio of small fireballs, shot from up to 48 blocks‌ or 16 blocks.‌ A blaze shoots only when it has a clear line of sight to its target. If line of sight is broken in the middle of its volley, the blaze suspends the remainder of its volley until line of sight returns. When using this attack, the blaze burns with fire for 3 seconds, shoots three small fireballs over the course of 0.9 seconds, then extinguishes its flames and waits for 5 seconds before attacking again. A blaze shoots its small fireballs with roughly the same lack of accuracy as a dispenser; however, the blaze's shots maintain the same speed all the way to the target, unlike the dispenser's, which start slow and accelerate. 
A blaze that touches its target performs a melee attack that does 6 damage on normal difficulty, once per second. This attack is not considered fire damage and does not ignite the target. This cannot be prevented by the Fire Resistance status effect.

== Trivia ==
Blazes can see the player through walls.
When throwing a potion of Invisibility on a blaze, the smoke remains visible.
According to Jens Bergensten, blazes look the way they do because all mobs in Minecraft are cuboid-shape, so to make them flame-like and magical, he created them as a core surrounded by rotating rods.
Blazes originally didn't have eyes when Jens Bergensten was first creating them and "just looked like a yellow rock". Eyes were added to "give it more personality".
Despite not having visible feet, blazes are still capable of making footstep sounds.
According to Minecraft's "Visit the Nether!" blazes are sentient beings made of pure lava. The article theorizes they were created by the original inhabitants of nether fortresses to serve as guards, but their creators lost control over the blazes and were subsequently destroyed by them.
On the official T-shirt "Alchemy" by JINX, the blaze is in the form of the Vitruvian Man and the text uses the Standard Galactic Alphabet. The words on the outside of the ring translate to: "nigredo", "albedo", "citrinitas", and "rubedo" which are all relating to magnum opus. The words on the ring translate to (starting from the top): "B * Crowmer", "poison * speed", "strenth * resist"  [sic], "vision * heal", and "regeneration" relating to potions and probably the artist's name. On the connecting lines the words translate to: "potln of thickness"  [sic], "potln of awkward"  [sic], "weakness potion" and "mundane potion" relating to base potions.
As part of an official collaboration, blazes are included as monsters in a free add-on for the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. In the game, they are "Elementals" and have the alignment "Typically Neutral Evil".
