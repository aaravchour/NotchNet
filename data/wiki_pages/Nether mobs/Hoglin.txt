A hoglin is a breedable hostile mob found in the Nether, and a source of porkchops and leather. A hoglin attacks by thrusting its tusks upward, which can also launch its target a short distance into the air. Hoglins are repelled by warped fungi that is placed in the world as well as active nether portals and respawn anchors.
Baby hoglins behave similarly, but have a much weaker attack (the weakest attack in the game) with normal knockback, and flee when hit.


== Spawning ==
Hoglins are found in herds of 3–4 in crimson forests, respawning over time. They can spawn at any light level and on most solid blocks other than nether wart blocks and shroomlights. 
Hoglins spawn in certain types of bastion remnants upon structure generation. They spawn frequently in the hoglin stable variant (specifically the large and small stables in the "lower" area, but never in the "upper" area with ramparts), and sometimes in the main "bridge entrance" at the upper half of the rampart in the bridge variant. Similarly to the piglins and piglin brutes there, these hoglins never despawn.
20% of hoglins spawn as babies.
Hoglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.


== Drops ==
Adult hoglins drop when killed:

2–4 raw porkchop (cooked porkchop while on fire). The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 7 with Looting III.
0–1 leather. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.
5‌ or 1–3‌ if killed by a player or tamed wolf.
Baby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins. They are also the only mobs that both grow up and also drop experience.


== Behavior ==
Hoglins avoid warped fungi (including in a flower pot), nether portals and respawn anchors, and will run away from them when within 7 blocks of them. They naturally sink in water and eventually drown. They also sink in lava and are vulnerable to fire damage. Hoglins can be led with a lead despite the fact they are hostile.


=== Hostility ===
Hoglins attack any player within 16 blocks with a reach of 1.9 blocks. An adult knocks its target upward. Players can still be flung even if they block with a shield. Hoglins do not attack a player standing near a block that repels them, but run away from the block unless they have already chosen to attack. Hoglins are 60% resistant to knockback. Unlike other hostile mobs, they do not prevent a player from sleeping.
Similarly to piglins and zombified piglins, a player or mob attacking a hoglin provokes all nearby hoglins. Attacking a baby hoglin does not trigger this behavior.
If a piglin attacks a hoglin, all the hoglins in the area retaliate. Hoglins also flee if outnumbered and make retreating sounds. If the piglins are outnumbered by hoglins, they flee and make retreating sounds.
Hoglins that spawn upon generation of bastion remnants are not hunted by piglins.


=== Baby hoglins ===
Baby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less damage and normal knockback. If the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.
Baby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins. If there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.


=== Zombification and Zoglins ===

If a hoglin spawns in or moves to the Overworld or the End, it shakes and then transforms into a zoglin after 15 seconds. The newly-created zoglin gets Nausea I for 10 seconds. This Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior. In Java Edition, any lead attached to the hoglin breaks when it converts, even though zoglins can have leads attached to them.


=== Breeding ===

Other than the killer bunny‌, the hoglin is the only hostile mob that can be bred. Hoglins can be bred using crimson fungi. It takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature. Baby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away. Feeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.
Hoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors or nether portals.
Feeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from despawning, regardless of whether the breeding is successful or not. The baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.


== Sounds ==

Hoglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

== Issues ==
Issues relating to "Hoglin" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.


== Trivia ==
The reason Hoglins run away from warped fungi is because they dislike their smell.
Similarly, when asked if nether portals smell bad to Hoglins, Henrik responded saying that the reason Hoglins run away from Nether Portals is because they find the sound annoying.
Similar to the ravager originally being called "illager beast" before its official name was chosen by the community, the Hoglin's name was also chosen by the community. Its initial placeholder name was "piglin beast".
In Bedrock Edition, there are unused texture files named hoglin_meat_raw and hoglin_meat_cooked that are textured identically to raw and cooked beef, respectively.
Henrik Kniberg released a video of a group of hoglins killing a piglin, then "celebrating" by bobbing their heads, then getting on their hind legs and dancing. This feature was never added into any snapshot and is not actually in Minecraft.
Hoglins were possibly inspired by wild boars and hogs.
