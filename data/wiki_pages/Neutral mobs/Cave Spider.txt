Cave spiders are small variants of the spider that inflict Poison with their attacks. They are exclusively spawned by monster spawners found in mineshafts.


== Spawning ==

Cave spiders spawn from monster spawners in mineshafts at a light level of 0. These monster spawners are surrounded by cobwebs in corridors of mineshafts.


== Drops ==

When killed, a cave spider drops:

0–2 String. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 string with Looting III.
5 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.
They also have a 1⁄3 chance of dropping a Spider Eye when killed by a player or tamed wolf. The maximum amount of spider eyes is increased by 1 per level of Looting. The chance of a cave spider not dropping any spider eyes can be found using the formula 2 / (Looting Level + 3). For example, Looting III gives a 1⁄3 chance of not dropping any spider eyes. All other amounts have an equal chance of occurring.


== Behavior ==
Cave spiders inherit their behavior from spiders:

Neutral if under daylight or in light levels of 9 or above, otherwise they are hostile towards players and iron golems. Once they become hostile, light does not affect them.
Climb walls when needed and may sometimes reach a corner and become stuck in a climbing status, thus losing and becoming unable to be aggravated.
Gravitate towards cobwebs.
Attack by leaping.
Are unaffected by cobwebs and Poison.
Can spawn spider jockeys.‌
They have some distinctions from regular spiders:

Can fit through a space that is one block wide and 1⁄2 block tall.
Can go through the spaces between two different types of (unconnected) fences.
Cannot spawn with status effects.
Being arthropods, they are weak against weapons with the Bane of Arthropods enchantment.
