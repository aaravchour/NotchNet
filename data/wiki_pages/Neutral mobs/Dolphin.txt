Dolphins are neutral mobs  that live in non-frozen oceans, which grant a speed boost to players that swim near them.


== Spawning ==
Dolphins are found in groups (pods) of 3–5 in all ocean biomes, except frozen oceans and cold oceans. They spawn exclusively between levels 50 and 64.
Dolphins continuously spawn as long as their spawn requirements are met, and naturally despawn if no players are near by, similar to squid. 
In Java Edition, dolphins and squids together make up the water creatures mob cap.
10% of dolphins spawn as babies.‌


== Drops ==
When killed, dolphins drop 0–1 raw cod (cooked cod if on fire). The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0–4 with Looting III. 1–3 are dropped as well.


== Behavior ==

Dolphins normally swim in pods, occasionally leaping out of the water to get air. They are also able to jump from one body of water to another. Additionally, they chase after players in boats.
Players who sprint-swim within a 9 block spherical radius of a dolphin receive Dolphin's Grace for 5 seconds‌. Players who already have Dolphin's Grace and continue to sprint-swim within a 15 block spherical radius of a dolphin will have it replenished. Players with Invisibility do not receive the effect unless they already had Dolphin's Grace before receiving Invisibility, or if they are wearing armor. The dolphin keeps following the player as long as they are sprint-swimming, allowing the player to swim under the speed boost for long distances. In Bedrock Edition, the player simply gets a swimming speed boost without a status effect.
Dolphins are lured by dropped items that are inside nearby water blocks, knocking them around and chasing them.‌ If the dolphin can not find a path to a dropped item, the dolphin may stay underwater to the point of drowning. If the dolphin is in, or on, a waterlogged bottom slab or chest with an air block above, the dolphin is prevented from drowning. 
Should the player or another mob hit a dolphin (unless the dolphin is killed within one hit‌), the whole pod retaliates, attacking all at once similar to wolves and zombified piglins. Hostile dolphins remain hostile even if they are fed fish.
Feeding dolphins raw cod or raw salmon improves their "trust" and interactions with the player, depending on the amount of fish fed. 
When dolphins are fed raw cod or raw salmon, they swim to the nearest shipwreck, buried treasure, or ocean ruins. Because they are locating the chest in the structures rather than the structures themselves, breaking the chests causes the dolphin to locate a new structure with intact chests. Dolphins also avoid guardians and elder guardians.


=== Weaknesses ===
If a dolphin leaves the water in dry weather, it starts taking suffocation damage after two minutes, and eventually dies. It takes no damage out of water during rain. Regardless of weather, a dolphin on land actively seeks out a body of water, or seeks its target if in a hostile state.
They cannot survive without getting air every once in a while, so if they stay submerged for about 4 minutes they begin drowning. The Water Breathing effect prevents them from drowning.
Dolphins cannot ride boats, similarly to squid and all types of fish.
Dolphins can be towed by a lead.
Because the dolphin is an aquatic mob, they are affected by the Impaling enchantment.‌

== Trivia ==
To create the sounds that the dolphins make in the game, Mojang Studios' lead sound designer, Samuel Åberg, went to Kolmården Wildlife Park to record real dolphins.
This was also done with pandas.
Dolphins originally had a separate head and body when shown in a clip at MINECON 2017. It is also shown in artwork for Java Edition 1.13.
Real-life dolphins don't suffocate outside of water; they breathe air like all mammals, although they can die of dehydration out of water.
In 2018, a mob vote was held in which Chinese users could vote on which Chinese animal should be added to Minecraft, to promote the release of Minecraft China. One of the options for voting was the possibly extinct Baiji Dolphin. The Panda won the vote and was added into the game.
During development, there were large disagreements between developers over how Dolphins should behave.
Mojang specifically stated that they will not consider allowing dolphins to be tamed or ridden.
They also decided against adding behaviors that deviate significantly from real-life dolphins, such as fleeing from drowned.
