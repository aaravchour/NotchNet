A panda is a rare neutral mob that resides in jungles. Certain aspects of a panda's behavior and appearance vary depending on its personality.


== Spawning ==
Pandas spawn rarely in groups of 1–2 in jungle biomes at the surface on grass blocks with at least two-block space above them at a light level of 9 or more. They are slightly more common in bamboo jungles and have a 5% chance to spawn as cubs instead of adults. They do not spawn on podzol despite that bamboo jungles are covered by it.
Pandas spawn with a randomized personality, with the normal personality being the most common and the brown variant being the rarest.


== Drops ==
Upon death, adult pandas drop:

1 bamboo, unaffected by Looting.‌
0-2 bamboo, increased 1 per level of Looting.‌
1–3, if killed by a tamed wolf or the player.
Baby pandas have a 1⁄700 chance to drop 1 slimeball after they sneeze.
Upon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.
Like other baby animals, killing a panda cub yields no items or experience.


== Behavior ==
Pandas act similarly to other neutral mobs; they attack when hurt but only once, similar to llamas and bees. Pandas do not attack on Peaceful difficulty. Pandas follow any player that is carrying bamboo and stop following if the player moves beyond approximately 16 blocks away. They also whimper if a thunderstorm is happening in the area. Adult pandas seek out bamboo and cake to eat.
Baby pandas have a 1⁄6000 chance (0.01666%) of sneezing every tick. Weak baby pandas are more likely to sneeze with a 1⁄500 (0.2%) chance every tick. Sneezing makes all adult pandas within 10 blocks jump and rarely drops a slimeball. Baby pandas also occasionally roll over and jump around.
Pandas have one private inventory.
Pandas can be ridden by baby zombie variants.‌
A lead cannot be used on a panda by normal means. However, a panda can be leashed using a map editor, an NBT editor, or by putting it on a boat and leashing the boat.
If a panda is being attacked by a player near a villager, that villager displays angry particles.‌ However, it does not affect the popularity of the player.


=== Personalities ===

Pandas have different personalities: normal, lazy, worried, playful, aggressive, weak, or brown.

 Normal pandas:
Identifiable by their frown.
Do not have unique personality actions.
 Lazy pandas:
Identifiable by their smile.
Lie on their backs.
Are slower than normal pandas, making them the slowest land mob in the game.
Do not follow a player who is holding bamboo while they're lying on their back.‌ In Bedrock Edition, if a player is holding bamboo, a lazy panda stops lying on its back and starts following that player.

 Worried pandas:
Identifiable by their worried expression.
Avoid the player and most hostile mobs, except slimes, magma cubes, ghasts, shulkers, phantoms and the ender dragon.
Shake and hide their faces during thunderstorms.
Do not eat bamboo or cake items on their own.

 Playful pandas:
Identifiable by their tongues which stick out.
Roll over and jump around even as adults. The ability to roll may sometimes cause harm or kill the panda as it can accidentally roll off a cliff or into other environmental hazards.
 Aggressive pandas:
Identifiable by their thick eyebrows and tight frown.
When hit, an aggressive panda attacks the player and other mobs continuously until the target dies or goes beyond detection range, instead of only once. It also doesn't panic when harmed.
When nearby pandas are attacked, unless killed in one hit,‌ aggressive pandas becomes hostile toward the attacker.
Are slow, but have reach rivaling that of the player.
 Weak pandas:
Identifiable by their teary eyes and snotty noses.
Tend to sneeze more often as babies than regular baby pandas, and have half the health of other pandas.
 Brown pandas:
Identifiable by their brown color and frown.
Do not have unique personality actions, but are brown and white instead of the usual black and white.


=== Breeding ===
The panda is the only animal to have extra breeding conditions. In Java Edition, pandas enter love mode when fed with bamboo, but will only breed if there is at least one bamboo block (not including shoots) within a five-block radius; otherwise the pandas will briefly shake their heads and not breed until that requirement is met.
In Bedrock Edition, there must be at least 8 bamboo blocks within a five-block radius of each panda in order for them to enter love mode. If a panda is fed without a sufficient amount of bamboo nearby, it sits and eats the bamboo instead of entering love mode.
Once pandas successfully breed, they produce a panda cub which remains passive instead of neutral toward that player.


== Genetics ==
Each panda has two hidden values called "genes" or "alleles", as found in genetics. Pandas have a main gene and a hidden gene, each assigned to a particular trait. Normal, aggressive, lazy, worried, and playful personalities are dominant traits, while weak and brown personalities are recessive traits. If the main gene is a dominant gene, then it will present as the personality regardless of the hidden gene. If the main gene is recessive and the hidden gene is not the same trait, then a normal personality results. As recessive traits, weak and brown personalities occur if both the main and hidden genes of a panda are weak or brown, respectively. The hidden gene is only relevant in determining the panda's personality if the main gene is recessive.
When two pandas breed, each one passes one of their genes to their children, who then randomly mix both obtained genes as their respective main and hidden genes. There is also a 1⁄32 chance for each gene of the baby to mutate into another gene. Normal, weak, and brown traits more commonly result from mutations than other traits do. These probabilities also apply to naturally spawned pandas for their main and hidden genes.

The only way to directly observe the hidden gene of a panda is to use the command : /data get entity @e[type=minecraft:panda,sort=nearest,limit=1] HiddenGene‌ or using third-party NBT editors.


== Sounds ==

Pandas use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

== Issues ==
Issues relating to "Panda" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.


== Trivia ==
To create the in-game sounds for pandas, Mojang Studios' lead sound designer, Samuel Åberg, went to Guangzhou, China, to record real-life pandas. This was also done with dolphins.
The brown panda, known as the Qinling panda, is actually a subspecies of the giant panda discovered in the 1960s.
The lazy panda is the slowest land mob in the game (not counting status effects such as Slowness).
The rarest mob in Bedrock Edition is a baby husk with equipment and armor riding a brown panda, which has a 2.88×10−13 percent (one in 3.472 trillion) chance of spawning.
Pandas were originally a bit slimmer.
