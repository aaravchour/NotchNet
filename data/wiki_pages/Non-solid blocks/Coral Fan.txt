Coral fans are non-solid blocks that come in 5 variants: tube, brain, bubble, fire, and horn.
Dead coral fans are the dead variants of coral fans.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Coral fans and their dead variants can be mined instantly but can be obtained only when mined with a Silk Touch enchanted tool. Breaking coral fans without Silk Touch destroys the coral fan.
Dead coral fans can only be obtained with a Silk Touch pickaxe.


=== Natural generation ===
Coral fans and dead coral fans‌ naturally generate in coral reef structures.


=== Post-generation ===


==== Bone meal ====
When bone meal is used in warm ocean biomes, it has a chance of generating coral fans.


==== Dead coral fans ====
In order for coral fans to stay alive, they must be placed in water. In Java Edition, coral fans can also be placed outside of water as long as one of the blocks surrounding it contains water. If placed outside of water, they transform into their respective dead coral fan immediately‌ or after a few seconds‌.


=== Wall coral fans ===
Wall coral fans cannot be obtained through vanilla means. In Java Edition, they are completely unobtainable, but in Bedrock Edition, they can be obtained through add-ons or inventory editing, though the item form is badly glitched to the point of being completely nameless.


== Usage ==
Coral fans and dead coral fans can be used for building or as decoration blocks.


=== Placement ===
All coral fans (and their dead variants) can be placed on the four sides and the top surface of blocks; they cannot be placed on the bottom surface.


=== Pushing with pistons ===
Live coral fans when being pushed by pistons will result in them breaking. Dead coral fans can be pushed by pistons as long as they will still be "supported" in their new position (not floating).
