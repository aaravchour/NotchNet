Grass (now called "Short Grass") is a solid plant block that has wheat seeds as a drop. Its color is biome-dependent, and matches the color of grass blocks.
Tall grass (in Java Edition), also known as double tallgrass (in Bedrock Edition), is a two-block high variety of grass.
Ferns are variants of grass found only in certain biomes and have the same characteristics as grass.
Large ferns are a two-block high variety of ferns. 


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
When broken normally, all variants have a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 unit of wheat seeds when destroyed. This is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping 1-3, 1-5, or 2-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III. They can be obtained as an item by destroying them with shears.
The double tall grass and large ferns drop two of the respective single blocks when broken using shears. By planting a single fern, growing it with bone meal and then using shears on the resulting tall fern, a single fern yields two ferns.
Placing any block on grass breaks the grass, and the grass does not drop seeds.


=== Natural generation ===


==== Grass ====
Grass generates in the form of random patches, on grass blocks in most biomes with grassy soil, like plains or forests. Tall grass generates in plains, savannas and lush caves. There is approximately 8.6 tall grass per chunk.

A woodland mansion can have grass being farmed on farmland in the "wheat farm" room.


==== Ferns ====
Ferns occur naturally only in jungle, taiga, snowy taiga and old growth taiga biomes. Large ferns generate in the same biomes, excluding jungles. Large ferns can be found in some taiga and snowy taiga‌ village houses.


=== Chest loot ===


=== Trading ===
Wandering traders can sell ferns for one emerald.


=== Post-generation ===
Bone meal can be used on a grass block to grow grass, ferns‌ and occasionally flowers on it and in its vicinity. It can also be used on grass or a fern to create a tall grass or large fern, respectively.


== Usage ==
Double tall plants have a disproportionately large hitbox compared to other plants. The only exception to this rule is tall seagrass.


=== Flower pots ===
Ferns can be placed in flower pots.


=== Composting ===
Placing grass into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
Placing tall grass into a composter has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
Placing a fern into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Issues ==
Issues relating to "Grass", "Fern", "Tall Grass", or "Large Fern" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.


== Trivia ==
Grass cannot be directly set on fire from lightning. However, fire from nearby blocks can spread to it. Oddly enough, the top of grass can be lit but it does not burn this way. When any kind of grass is set on fire, the fire seems to hover just over the grass, as if it were a full block.
Even though ferns do not produce seeds in real life, as they emit spores instead, they can drop seeds if broken.
Grass is slightly offset from the block it is sitting on (as seen in the second screenshot). This causes fields of grass to appear more contiguous.
This offset is solely determined by x and z coordinates, regardless of dimension or world seed. Based on this feature, it is possible to calculate the coordinates where a screenshot is taken, if the screenshot includes enough grass.
This can sometimes cause grass to clip horizontally or vertically through block corners.
Grass can appear in caves on dirt, even if there's no light source nearby.
Using bone meal on grass in a spawn-protected area on a server still produces grass and flowers.
The texture for grass is based on the grass texture from an early version of one of Notch's games, Prelude Of The Chambered
