The Minecraft Antiquated Robot Inadequate Loves Lying Audaciously, also known as MARILLA or M.A.R.I.L.L.A, is a character in the official Minecraft YouTube channel voiced by Marilla Wex.
She hosted the series Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft and then co-hosted The Secrets of Minecraft with Narrator from How We Make Minecraft.


== Appearance ==
MARILLA is an old box computer with a creamy tan colored base, dark brown casing, a green and white screen, a gray keyboard and a "Team Player Mode" switch on the back. A ROM cartridge with Minecraft on it can be seen sticking out and a joystick sitting at the side connected by a cable. She is able to run programs such as Minecraft on herself.


== Personality ==
MARILLA is lighthearted, sarcastic, confidant, and audacious. She is quick to give false trivia and can be a little superstitious but always does so with positive boldness. She likes endermen.

== Trivia ==
The introductory sentences has minor differences depending on the video, some being in the greetings: "Hello!", "Hello there!", or "Hello again!" along with the glitching. The modem sound is also occasionally "[MODEM SOUND VARIATION 3582]" instead of the usual "[OLD MODEM SOUND]".
MARILLA is the second computer character in the Minecraft franchise after PAMA.
The squid overlords taking over Minecraft that MARILLA occasionally mentions may be a reference to the antisemitic conspiracy theory of reptilian overlords controlling Earth.
MARILLA implied at one point that a witch offered her three magic beans in exchange for her body being trapped in a computer for all eternity.
The description card on Minecraft's YouTube channel has her as "Artificial Untelligence", [sic] "Sentient computer/worryingly immortal", "Excellent liar", etc. This changes each episode.
Her co-host, Narrator, believes that "MARILLA was created a few thousand years before rocks were invented".
Her name is likely based on her actress Marilla Wex, as seen by the acronym having random words that spell out "MARILLA".
The glitchy introductions feature MARILLA displaying a mockup of the boot loader 'Kickstart' from the Commodore Amiga line of computers, a slight nod to our underground demoscene roots.
