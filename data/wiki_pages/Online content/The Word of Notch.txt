The Word of Notch was Notch's Tumblr-powered personal blog, which functioned as a development feed for Minecraft. The Word of Notch could be used to view old Minecraft blog posts that go all the way back to May 13, 2009, when Minecraft began development, up to around the Adventure Update, when update content posts from Notch became less frequent. When the blog was no longer used for Minecraft development, it was removed from the Official links section on the Minecraft website. 
The Word of Notch contained information revealing future updates, as well as daily happenings at the Mojang office and behind-the-scenes posts about Minecraft's history and technical aspects. The blog also contained a direct feed from his Twitter account. After Notch stopped working on Minecraft, his posts were made up of his opinions and daily thoughts or focuses, which were only posted about once every couple of months.
The last post on The Word of Notch was from August 19th, 2013, titled "So that's what I'm going to do", detailing what his plans were after he cancelled development on the unreleased game 0x10c.
On August 26, 2021, it was discovered that the blog had disappeared, for reasons unknown. Possible explanations may include manual deletion by Notch himself, or Tumblr removing the blog due to it being inactive. Image links from the blog were replaced with disclaimers stating that the content had been removed for "violating Tumblr's community guidelines".
