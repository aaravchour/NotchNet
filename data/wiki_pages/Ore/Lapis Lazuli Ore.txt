Lapis lazuli ore is the ore block from which lapis lazuli is obtained.
Deepslate lapis lazuli ore is a variant of lapis lazuli ore that generates in deepslate layers.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===

Lapis lazuli ore generates in the Overworld in the form of ore features. It generates in two batches per chunk:

The first batch attempts to generate 2 times per chunk, in sizes of 0-10, from levels -32 to 32. It is most common around level 0 and becomes less common towards either end of the range.
The second batch attempts to generate 4 times per chunk, in sizes of 0-10, evenly from levels -64 to 64. Lapis lazuli ore in this second batch cannot be exposed to air; any ore blocks that would generate exposed do not generate.
Lapis lazuli ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff‌, and deepslate. Any lapis lazuli ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate variant.


=== Breaking ===
Lapis lazuli ore can be mined with a stone pickaxe or higher. To obtain the block itself, the player must use Silk Touch; otherwise, the block drops 4–9 lapis lazuli. When mined with a Fortune enchanted pickaxe, there is a chance for the drops to be multiplied by between 2 and the level plus 1, up to a maximum of 2 to 4 at level III (for a maximum of 36 lapis lazuli dropped). This means at Fortune III there is a chance to get a minimum of 4 lapis lazuli or 36 lapis lazuli. See the chart "The drops per fortune level are as follows:" below.

The drops per fortune level are as follows:

Lapis ore also drops 2–5 when broken without Fortune.
