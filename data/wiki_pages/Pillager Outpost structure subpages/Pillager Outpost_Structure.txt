== Blueprint ==


=== Pillager outpost (Watchtower) ===

Layer 2 - All slabs=top, stairs facing birch planks.
Layer 4 - Dark oak stair blocks face the corners and are upside down.
Layer 4 & 5 - All slabs = bottom.
Layer 6 - Cobblestone stair face inside and upside down. Slabs = top. Logs in the middle of the sides of the floor (just inside the cobblestone balcony) are laid horizontally.
Layer 9 - Slabs = Top
Layer 10 to 12 - Logs in the wall (not the corners) must be facing outwards.
The hole for the stair in Layer 6 is 100% accurate.
