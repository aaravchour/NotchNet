An oak is the most common tree in the game, found in a variety of biomes, available in several variants. It has the smallest initial space requirement for growth, and along with dark oak trees, it has a chance to drop an apple when a leaf block is destroyed. As with birches, an oak tree grown near flowers can generate with a bee nest attached.


== Variants ==
Oaks come in several variants with different properties:

Small regular oaks are the most common. The leaves are arranged the same as the birch leaf arrangement and as some jungle trees, albeit rare.
Fancy oaks are less common and have a distinct look and different growth requirements. They often have branches, outgrowths of logs on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding and surrounded by leaves. The sapling requires 4–14 blocks of open space directly above to grow (air or leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides.
A fancy oak form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, rarely allowing a tree to grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise, the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6.
An oak can be forced into a fancy configuration if a "brace" of non-solid blocks (e.g. glass or slabs) is placed around where the trunk would be, one block off the ground.
A rare variant is colloquially known as a "balloon" oak. This is a fancy oak generated with the smallest size possible. It consists of a tall trunk and leaves that form a spherical shape, similar to a balloon. These oaks can grow around an obstructing block. They usually contain 4 blocks of logs, but some may contain more.
In swamp biomes, naturally occurring swamp oaks tend to grow in the water. Unlike trees in other biomes, which typically have a slightly conical or pointed canopy, all swamp oaks have round, flat-topped canopies. Also unlike oaks, these have a broad range of foliage. They tend to be covered in vines that trail down to the ground.

An oak tree with a unique arrangement of leaves is generated at meeting point 3, in plains villages. This leaf arrangement is not found elsewhere naturally, and it cannot be grown from a sapling.
In some of the Trial Chamber entrance rooms, a small oak tree generates inside a 3 x 4 block copper ring, next to a water block.


== Generation ==
The oak tree variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes:


== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from all variants of oak:

Apple (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Bee Nest (if spawned on an oak near flowers)
Mushrooms (if present on a fallen oak log)
Oak Leaves (harvested with shears)
Oak Log (harvested with any tool including hands)
Oak Planks (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
Oak Sapling (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Stripped Oak Log (created by using an axe on a log)
Vines (harvested with shears from a swamp oak, or from a dying tree‌)
Stick (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)


== Planting ==
Oak saplings can be planted and grown on all of these blocks:

Dirt
Grass Block
Coarse Dirt
Podzol
Mycelium
Rooted Dirt
Moss Block
Farmland
Mud
Muddy Mangrove Roots
An oak tree requires a 1×1 column of unobstructed space at least 4 blocks above its sapling to grow (5 blocks including the sapling itself). Oak trees can still grow when the base and trunk are enclosed on all sides. Their growth is not hindered by logs, leaves, dirt, or saplings.
An oak tree grown from a sapling within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a bee nest containing 2 bees.


== Other variant oaks ==
Sometimes, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.


=== Dying oak ===
A dying oak has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines. They can generate as regular or small oak trees.


=== Fallen oak log ===
These trees consist of a single upright log or stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.
A fallen oak has a log length of 4–7 blocks and the stump is 75% covered with vines.
