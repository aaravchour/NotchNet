A spore blossom is a ceiling-hanging decorative block that emits green particles.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===
Spore blossoms can be found only on the ceiling of lush caves.


=== Breaking ===
Spore blossoms can be broken instantly using any item or by hand. Harvesting a spore blossom using shears consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.


== Usage ==
Spore blossoms can be placed only on the underside of any block except for leaves.
They emit two kinds of particles: one falling straight downwards, disappearing after a certain distance; the other spreading to a large area, floating around in the air, spreading further away as they slowly fall down.
Spore blossoms can be pollinated by bees.


=== Composting ===
Spore blossoms can be put into a composter with a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
