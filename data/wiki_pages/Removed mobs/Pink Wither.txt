The pink wither or friendly wither was a recurring April Fools' mob present in both Java Edition 2.0 and 15w14a.


== Behavior ==


=== 2.0 ===
In 2.0, the pink wither could be summoned by placing a potted rose on top of pink wool. The newly spawned mob has one head.
The pink wither was an undead hostile mob that would follow players holding sugar, and feeding it sugar would cause it to grow more heads, up to a maximum of three. Unlike the normal wither, the pink wither is not able to fly and when a pink wither skull hits a block it grows plants in a radius of 15x4x15 blocks.


=== 15w14a ===
In 15w14a, the pink wither replaces the wither, firing skulls that have a bone meal effect instead of the normal Wither II effect.
When spawned, the pink wither has three heads like a normal wither. It also creates an explosion effect after spawning and has a shield after losing half of its health. The skulls fired by the pink wither firing are the same as the regular wither's, but pink instead of black. The pink wither's skulls often heal the entities, but can damage them, too.


== Drops ==
The pink wither drops 50 and a Nether Star when killed.
