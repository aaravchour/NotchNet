A minecart with chest is a single chest inside a minecart, and functions as such.


== Natural generation ==
Minecarts with chests containing loot naturally generate in mineshafts, each on top of a piece of rail.


== Obtaining ==


=== Crafting ===

Minecarts with chests can be retrieved by attacking them. By doing so it drops as an item and any other contents of the chest are dropped as well.


== Usage ==

Minecarts with chests can be placed by using its item on any type of rail.
Chest minecarts' contents can be accessed by pressing use item button on them. The interaction makes no sounds and the chest does not show the opening or closing animation, unlike regular chests.
The boost that minecarts with chests gain from powered rails is dependent on their load. For example, from a 1 powered rail starter track, an empty minecart with chest travels 64 blocks, but a full minecart with chest travels only 16 blocks (opposed to 80 blocks for an occupied normal minecart and 8 blocks for an empty normal minecart).
Another physical property of chest minecarts is their ability to be stacked. While three chests can fit in an area three blocks tall, up to four chest minecarts can fit in the same area. Like other minecarts, an unlimited number of minecarts with chests can exist in the same block space.
Minecarts with chests are also able to interact with hoppers. Hoppers can take items out from the minecart chest if they are below the track as the minecart rolls over it or put them in if the minecart rolls under a downward facing hopper. Hoppers can also input items if they are facing into the side of the minecart.
Opening or destroying a minecart with chest angers piglins.

When on top of detector rails, nearby redstone comparators will give out redstone signals based on how full the minecarts with chests are.
