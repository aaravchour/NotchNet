A smoker is a block that smelts foods twice as quickly as a furnace but cannot smelt anything else. It also serves as a butcher's job site block.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
A smoker can be picked up using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it does not drop itself.
Smokers drop their contents when broken.


=== Natural generation ===
Smokers can generate in butcher houses in villages.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
Smokers cannot be pushed by pistons.‌


=== Smelting ===

Smokers are used to cook food items twice as fast as a normal furnace. It is the counterpart to the blast furnace, which is used to quickly smelt ores, metal tools and armor. When a food item and a fuel item are placed into the smoker, the block state changes to lit and the item cooks. Fuel is used at double the rate of normal furnaces, so the number of items cooked per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by pressing use on the smoker or by collecting the output using a hopper.
Smokers cannot cook chorus fruit, as popped chorus fruit is not edible.


=== Changing profession ===
If a village has a smoker that has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby villager who hasn't chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to butcher.


=== Light source ===
Smokers emit a light level of 13 when active, just like normal furnaces.


=== Custom name ===
By default, the interface of a smoker is labeled "Smoker", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command‌.


=== Lock ===
In Java Edition, a smoker can be "locked" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a smoker's Lock tag is not blank, the smoker cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a smoker at (0,64,0) so that the smoker cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named "Smoker Key", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:"Smoker Key"}.


=== Note blocks ===
Smoker can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
