== Ocean Monument ==
Ocean monuments are naturally generated underwater structures that appear in deep oceans. They are inhabited by guardians and elder guardians. Below are instructions on how to recreate your own.
For Structures, see [here]


== Considerations ==
Ocean Monuments generate with water source blocks instead of air. For simplicity, the below blueprints use air, but you may wish to add water in place of air. To do this, you will need to begin on a completely solid surface and lay down water source blocks as you go.
If it has no water, Ocean Monuments have inaccessible floors (floors that can't be reached by jumping) in Survival mode. You may need to add some water or additional blocks to access the upper floors.
A player-made Ocean Monument will not spawn Guardians or Elder Guardians, even if flooded. The only way is to use a Spawn Egg.


== Requirements ==
Space: A 58 × 58 block area to build in. A height of at least 22 blocks or more if foundational pillars are included


== Resources or Materials ==
These numbers are for Penthouse layers and above ONLY, they will be updated at some point.


== Blueprint ==
To save space, some layers will begin at an offset. The top-left corner is at coordinate (1,1). The bottom-right corner is at coordinate (58,58). The monument entrance is at the bottom of the blueprints. Possible rooms are outlined in Redstone Blocks. See Monument/Structure for more on room generation. Pillars extend downward to the ocean floor.
