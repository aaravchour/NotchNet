== Trivia ==
Nautili are inspired by ammonites, an extinct aquatic mollusc species that lived in shells.
They were referred to as being extinct in Minecraft once.
The size of the Nautilus in-game, while dramatically oversized compared to the real animal, seems comparable to the real-life ammonite species Parapuzosia seppenradensis, known as the largest known ammonite in the fossil record.
According to Wikipedia, pufferfish are poisonous to all nautili.
