A nautilus is an neutral tamable mob that will be added in Mounts of Mayhem. It can be tamed using pufferfish, can be bred and fed using any fish or any type of fish bucket, equip with Nautilus Armor, and can be ridden on using a saddle. It was revealed in Minecraft Live - September 2025.


== Spawning ==
Nautili usually spawn in all ocean biomes. Normally in groups of 1-2. Also in the ocean biomes, Baby Nautili can also spawn.


== Usage ==
Tamed nautili can be equipped with a Nautilus Armor and can be ridden on by using a saddle. When ridden, it gives a "Breath of the Nautilus" effect, which pauses the player's oxygen bar and prevents the player from drowning.


== Behavior ==
Nautili are pasive to the player and other mobs, but they are hostile to the putterfish. If a player attacks them, they'll become hostile to them. They use their mouths to propel forward. It cannot survive on land or in lava. It can use its dash attack to inflict damage on the player or other mobs.

== Trivia ==
The Nautilus is the second Minecraft mob to be based on a living fossil, the first being the Axolotl.
Nautili are inspired by ammonites, an extinct aquatic mollusc species that lived in shells.
They were referred to as being extinct in Minecraft once.
The size of the Nautilus in-game, while dramatically oversized compared to the real animal, seems comparable to the real-life ammonite species Parapuzosia seppenradensis, known as the largest known ammonite in the fossil record.
According to Wikipedia, pufferfish are poisonous to all nautili.
