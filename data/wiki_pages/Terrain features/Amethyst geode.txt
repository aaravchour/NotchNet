An amethyst geode is a feature found in the underground of the Overworld. Amethyst geodes contain smooth basalt, calcite, and are the main source of amethyst items and blocks.


== Generation ==
Amethyst geodes generate between Y=-58 and Y=30. Each chunk has a 1⁄24 chance to attempt to generate a geode.


== Structure ==

Amethyst geodes consist of three layers: an outer layer of smooth basalt, a middle layer of calcite, and a hollow layer of primarily amethyst blocks, with 8.3% replaced by budding amethyst blocks instead. Amethyst crystals generate within the structure on budding amethyst. Geodes have a 95% chance of generating with a crack, exposing its inside. Caves, aquifers, and canyons may be overridden by geodes, and as such are often obstructed by them.
