Basalt pillars are tall features made up of basalt block.


== Generation ==
Basalt pillars are found in soul sand valleys.


== Construction ==
Basalt pillars have their starting points in the ceiling of an area, then have a pillar of between one and three blocks wide in both the X and Z axis going all the way down to the ground, where a flat clump of basalt can be found around a 3×3 area from the center of the pillar, as if a vertical lava flow, like those commonly found in the Nether, had solidified.
