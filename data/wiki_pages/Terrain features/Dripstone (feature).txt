Dripstone features can be found commonly in dripstone caves biomes. There are three types of dripstone feature: Large Dripstone, Dripstone Cluster and Pointed Dripstone (aka. Small Dripstone).


== Description ==
Dripstone features generate inside large hollows in the dripstone caves biome. They can generate in water.
There are three types of dripstone feature:

The first type is the "large dripstone", which takes the form of either a separated stalagmite and stalactite, or a stalagnate, and is composed of dripstone blocks. Stalagnates generate around two positions selected on the floor and ceiling of a cave, which may potentially be separated by several blocks horizontally. The maximum possible size of a large dripstone varies depending on the available space.
The second type is the "dripstone cluster", a patch of dripstone blocks replacing a section of a cave’s walls, floor and ceiling. Some Pointed dripstone blocks will generate hanging from the ceiling and growing on the floor in these patches, attached to the dripstone blocks, forming detailed speleothem growths. Water puddles can also occasionally be found on the floor patches.
The third type is the "pointed dripstone", which is similar to the dripstone cluster, but only has a single stalagmite or stalactite.
When these types overlap, it results in pointed dripstone generating on the large columns of dripstone blocks.

== Trivia ==
For a brief time in snapshot 21w06a, dripstone clusters were one of the only underground structures that did not generate correctly in negative y levels. This was because the developers initially hardcoded the minimum y level to be 0, intending to change it when changing the world height, then forgot to.
