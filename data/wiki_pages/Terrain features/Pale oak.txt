A pale oak tree is a rare variant of the dark oak tree. They are commonly found in the pale garden biome.


== Structure ==
Pale oak trees generate with thick 2×2 trunks. Dirt blocks appear under the trunk if generated on a steep cliff. Pale oak trees nearly always generate with irregular logs connected to the trunk – these represent large branches. Naturally generated Pale oak trees sometimes generate with a Creaking Heart in the trunk. Pale Hanging Moss also generates under the Pale oak Leaves canopy.


== Generation ==
Pale oaks spawn naturally only in the Pale Garden biome. A pale oak always generates with dirt under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over air or water blocks.


== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from all variants of pale oak:

Apple (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Pale Oak Leaves (harvested with shears)
Pale Oak Log (harvested with any tool including hands)
Pale Oak Planks (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
Pale Oak Sapling (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Stripped Pale Oak Log (created by using an axe on a log)
Stick (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)


== Planting ==
Pale oak saplings can be planted on:

Dirt
Grass Block
Coarse Dirt
Podzol
Mycelium
Rooted Dirt
Moss Block
Farmland
Mud
Muddy Mangrove Roots
Growing these trees requires four pale oak saplings arranged in a 2×2 grid; they do not grow if planted individually.

== Trivia ==
When a player bonemeals pale oak saplings on the ground, they do not generate with the Creaking Heart and Pale Hanging Moss.
