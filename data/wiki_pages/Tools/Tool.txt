A tool is an item used by the player while held to perform actions faster and more efficiently, to gather materials not obtainable by hand, to gain information, or to perform completely new actions. With the exception of the clock, compass, empty bucket, and lead, tools do not stack in the inventory. Tools can be repaired; see Item repair.

Some tools are not block-breaking tools: This includes bows, fishing rods, carrots on sticks, flint & steel, and buckets. Such tools are no better than bare fists at breaking blocks, but they do not take damage from doing so—they take damage from being used in their own intended manners.
