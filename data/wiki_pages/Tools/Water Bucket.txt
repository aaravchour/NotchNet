A water bucket is a bucket filled with water.


== Obtaining ==


=== Interacting ===
To fill an empty bucket with water, use it on a water source block. The water is consumed in the process. Flowing water does not fill a bucket.
Using an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with water (water level 3) empties the cauldron and fills the bucket.
Water buckets can also be filled by placing an empty one in the fuel slot of a furnace, and a wet sponge into the oven slot. The bucket is filled when the smelting process completes, which also leaves the sponge dry and ready to be reused.


=== Chest Loot ===


== Usage ==
Using a water bucket on a solid block places a water source block against that block, emptying the bucket; using a water bucket on a waterloggable block waterlogs the block. In the Nether, however, the water evaporates, making a fire extinguishing sound and displays smoke particles while nothing gets placed.


=== Dispensers ===
A dispenser can be loaded with a water bucket, and when activated it places a water block directly before it, emptying the bucket. A dispenser loaded with an empty bucket and a water source right in front of it draws the source into the bucket when activated.


=== Cauldrons ===
A single water bucket can fill a cauldron, and using an empty bucket on a water-filled cauldron fills the bucket. Empty buckets cannot be filled from partly-filled cauldrons.


=== Filling bucket with mobs ===
Water buckets can be used on a fish, axolotl or tadpole to create a bucket of aquatic mob.


=== Transportation ===

Water buckets can be used as a means of quickly descending great heights in the Overworld and the End, either by creating a waterfall or using the water bucket while falling to create a safe water landing.
Water buckets can also be used to climb vertical surfaces anywhere but the Nether by repeatedly creating higher waterfalls from the bottom and swimming up them.
