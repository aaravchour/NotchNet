The Minecraft community has developed some standards of gaming to help new Minecraft players become comfortable with the game. Millions of users have at some point been too inefficient or died unnecessarily. Therefore, a collected list of things the player should not do or forget has been compiled below in order to make the game experience as enjoyable as possible, This guide should help players get the grips of adventuring and being away from base for long periods of time.
Regardless of the advice given here, players should feel free to ignore any advice and play the game in their own way.


== Preparation ==
Before an adventure or trip, you may want to go and gather food, it is good to spend a couple of days at base before you set off.


=== Tools ===
Do not bring any valuables unless the purpose of the adventure is for resources, if within in that case bring a spare, You are better off with iron as it can be easily replaced with iron farms or mining. 


=== Food ===
Bring a stack (64) of cooked meat of any kind, Otherwise bring supplies for farming in the case you will be away from your base for a long period of time.


=== Blocks ===
Bring a couple stacks of wood and cobblestone in the event you will be away from your base for a long time, this will prove handy in making small bases, however you do not need to gather blocks if you decide to live in caves, which you still shouldn't neglect keeping some, as you will need a crafting table or furnace.


=== Travelling ===
Use horses! Try and get a fast one, but the jumping ability is not a major concern, however it may be handy for jumping across rivers or 2-block tall structures. If on feet, avoid sprinting to conserve food.


== Leaving base ==


=== Storage ===
Make sure to leave anything that you don't need, this will be quite useful when exploring for otherworldly resources.


=== Base ===
Make sure that nothing can go in apart from yourself, this can be as simple as closing or blocking up a door. Make sure the base is lit up so that mobs dont spawn inside of it, Make sure to keep your tamed mobs somewhere secure so you don't end up taking them with you unknowingly.


=== Livestock ===
Make sure to do a breed, so that when you come back you have lots of more animals to work with.


== During an adventure ==
Unless you’re going to a specific coordinate, the complete randomness of Minecraft will intrigue you.


== Desert pyramids ==

Ignore these, looting pyramids wastes time.
