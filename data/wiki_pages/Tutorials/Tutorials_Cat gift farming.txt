Cat gift farming is a process of using a tamed cat to give you items in the morning if it sleeps on or is near enough to a bed which the player is sleeping in to skip the night. It allows you to renewably farm rabbit's feet, rabbit hide, string, rotten flesh, feathers, raw chicken and phantom membranes without much effort, and is another option of obtaining phantom membranes if killing phantoms is not a viable option (e.g. a server with One Person Sleeps mod, or a half hearted hardcore world).
