Ender dragon farming is the process of farming Minecraft's final boss by respawning it using end crystals and killing it with a farm mechanism, ideally with TNT, withers or a player. It does not yield any drops on its own but is one of the most powerful XP farms in the game. You can also farm end stone with this because end stone generates under the bedrock portal frame every time the dragon respawns, and torches with a system that will break them and collect them. You can even farm obsidian with this method using trapped withers in the right places, since the obsidian that makes up the end spikes/towers regenerate when the dragon is resurrected.

These videos explain how to make contraptions to do this.
