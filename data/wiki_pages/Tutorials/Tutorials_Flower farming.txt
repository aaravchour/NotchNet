Flowers are useful for decoration, dyes, and breeding rabbits and bees.
To grow flowers, you can use bone meal on a grass block. The block must either have no block above it (which is obstructing sun / moonlight), or be lit with a light level of at least 8. Flowers and tall grass will spread over grass blocks up to 7 blocks away in both directions (a 15×15 square). However, approximately 95% of growth occurs within a 4-block radius (a 9×9 area) around the source grass block.
The types of flowers that spawn depend on the biome. See flower biomes.
Two-high flowers cannot be grown this way at all; instead, they can be farmed by applying bone meal directly to them, which causes an item to drop.
If you use bone meal directly on a one-high flower, it will spread (similar to using it on a grass block).‌
If the planting conditions are not met, flowers will quickly pop out. This allows flowers to be used in the creation of light-sensitive mechanisms.
Poppies are also a byproduct of iron farms, as iron golems will (apart from the iron) drop 0-2 poppies on death.
Poppies spawn much less frequently than dandelions. They are the most abundant in Mountains biomes, but are also somewhat common in Taiga and Tundra biomes.


== Location ==
                                                                           
In Java Edition, small flowers cannot be duplicated by using bone meal on them, so they have to be generated by using bone meal on grass blocks within the right biome.
The best location to build a flower farm is on the border of a flower forest and a regular swamp (not a mangrove swamp), so that all types of small flowers (except wither roses) can be farmed within a single area. This occurs very rarely, only once every couple thousand blocks, so it's best to search such locations using a seed finding program. 


== Fortune Enchantment ==
                                                                           
Step 1: Get something with fortune.
Step 2: Break a 2 block tall flower (Peony, rose bush, lilac, sunflower, etc.)
Step 3: Collect the 2+ flowers
It is also tracked on MCPE-18880.


== Shifting floor design ==
Another technique for automated farming is to shift the ground beneath the flowers with pistons.
The general idea is to have a redstone clock trigger the following three events in order:

A dispenser dispenses bone meal into the grass from below to produce flowers.
A set of pistons pushes the ground one block horizontally
Another set of pistons pushes the ground back to the original position.


=== Size comparison ===
This chart shows the area and flower yield of different sized designs, as well as the necessary number of pistons.

*The 2x2 design has no center, making it harder to use/build. This applies to any even size.
**A 15x15 area guarantees that no flower will fail to generate, but note that the earthquake collection method cannot be used (there are too many blocks for pistons to push). A somewhat complex water flow system is necessary for automatic collection. In Bedrock Edition, you can tap a flower w/ bone meal and it will multiply. Sadly, in Java Edition, you can only use this technique on two block high flowers.
