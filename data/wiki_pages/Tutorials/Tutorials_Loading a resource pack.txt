These tutorials are meant to help you use resource packs in Minecraft. Resource packs allow players to customize textures, music, sounds, language files, end credits, splashes, and fonts but do not change the actual gameplay.


== Any platform ==
Download a resource pack, you should get a .zip file
Open the folder to which you downloaded the file
Copy the .zip file
Open Minecraft
In Minecraft, click on "Options", then "Resource Packs"
Choose "Open resource pack folder"
Paste the file into the resource folder in Minecraft
Go back to Minecraft, the resource pack should now be listed (if not listed then go to the main menu by pressing Esc and repeat step 5) and you can activate it by choosing it and hitting "Done". The game will now reload itself.
