== Installation ==
Install the Java developer kit and the minecraft installer script
$ doas pkg_add jdk minecraft

Run minecraft and follow what it tells you to do via terminal, then run minecraft again to start Minecraft. The setup script will only run the first run after installation.
Do not change the executable location in your launcher profile as Minecraft will not launch, OpenBSD needs Minecraft to run from a set location to correctly work.


== Running a server ==
Download the server java executable (.jar) from the Minecraft website, place it in a directory within your home directory (or wherever accessible), then cd to that directory and run: 

$ java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar --nogui

to start the server.
You may want to write a shell file with:

$ nano minecraft_server.sh

then enter:

java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar --nogui

Press CTRL-X then Y to save.
To make this runnable through a file explorer, use:

$ chmod +x minecraft_server.sh

Otherwise use:

$ sh minecraft_server.sh
