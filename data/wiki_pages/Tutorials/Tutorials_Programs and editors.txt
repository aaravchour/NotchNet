The Minecraft community has created thousands of programs and modifications that can be used to enhance the game.


== List of programs and editors ==
The server software list is so large that it has a wiki of its own. Server wrappers can be used to help manage the server.
There are several kinds of programs which deal with Mapping:
Mappers create an overhead view of a world, usually outputted as a single graphic or Google Maps page.
Viewers provide an interactive view into the world, sometimes in 3D.
Map editors let the player directly alter a world outside of the game.
Map generators create new terrain types and block patterns that aren't available normally.
Mods add completely new features or modes of play to the core Minecraft game; there are a number of modding tools for creating and installing them.
To make new entities within a mod, the player also needs a 3D modeler.
Skinning and texturing programs help with designing player skins and texturing entities.
Resource pack builders help players with creation of resource packs which can change the appearance of the world.
Backup utilities make it easy to play your favorite worlds on mulitple computers as well as giving the peace of mind knowing that the worlds are safe.
Reference programs provide useful information, though they do not interact with the game directly.
3D Exporters allow Minecraft worlds to be converted into 3D objects.
In Bedrock Edition, there is an official way to do this, using structure blocks.
Commandblock helpers create, compile and/or bundle languages and text files to command blocks
Finally, there are Specialized programs for simulating redstone circuits, altering game files at a low level, and other purposes that don't fit into another category.
There is also a small collection of apps for iOS, iPadOS, and Android devices. These tools will not work for iOS or iPadOS unless the device is jailbroken.
Some .NET apps may require Mono to run on macOS and Linux.
