Redstone mechanics provide Minecraft with a loose analogue to electricity, which is useful for controlling and activating a variety of mechanisms. Redstone circuits and devices have many uses including automatic farms, controlling doorways, changeable or mobile buildings, transporting players and mobs, and more. 
Redstone construction can range from fairly simple to deeply complex.  While there is not a single overarching tutorial, there are many relevant pages under both the "Mechanics" and "Tutorials" trees. Some relevant pages include: 

Redstone dust:  The core material that enables most redstone devices, being crafted into many of them and also placed to carry signals.
Mechanics/Redstone:  The basic game mechanics for redstone power and signals.
Mechanics/Redstone/Components:  The blocks that are used in and with redstone contraptions.
Tutorials/Redstone tips:  Hints and advice for building your redstone devices.
Mechanics/Redstone/Circuit:  Lists various types of reusable circuits that can be used to manipulate signals, with sub-pages giving examples of the various types.
Help:Schematic:  The "modern" way for redstone circuits to be represented on this wiki.
MCRedstoneSim schematics:  An older method for displaying redstone circuits.
Some pages dealing with specific blocks:

Mechanics/Redstone/Piston circuits: A list of circuits making use of piston mechanics.
Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity: Discusses the special mechanic of Quasi-connectivity.
Tutorials/Hopper:  All about how to use hoppers, including for item sorting.
Tutorials/Observer stabilizer:  Getting a better signal out of an observer
Tutorials/Daylight detector, Tutorials/Day and night detector:  Daylight sensors
Tutorials/Automatic Respawn Anchor Recharger:  Respawn Anchors
Circuits can be built into more complex devices:

Tutorials/Mechanisms:  Lists an assortment of complete devices using redstone.
Tutorials/Minecarts:  Large railway systems can benefit from redstone at the terminals.
Tutorials/Redstone music:  Creating music with Note Blocks and redstone circuits.
Tutorials/Rube Goldberg machine:  Complexity and spectacle!
Tutorials/Block update detector: A specialized class of circuit; BUDs are mostly but not completely rendered obsolete by the Observer.
Tutorials/Comparator update detector:  An extension of BUDs that also spots inventory changes.
Tutorials/Shulker box storage: Systems for loading and unloading shulker boxes.
Tutorials/Zero-ticking: Exploiting a notable bug for rapid circuits.
Tutorials/Combination locks: Creating combination locks
Tutorials/Elevators:  Vertical transportation
Tutorials/Telegraph:  Long-range signaling (through loaded chunks only)
Tutorials/Command block:  Use of creative-mode Command blocks
Tutorials/Flying machines: Mobile machinery!
Tutorials/Note block music: A working music machine!
Perhaps the most ambitious redstone project of all is to build a working computer within Minecraft!

Tutorials/Logic gates:  Arithmetic logic.
Tutorials/Advanced redstone circuits
Tutorials/Redstone computers:
Tutorials/Calculator:  Build a calculator within Minecraft.
Tutorials/Printing:  And a printer/3D printer.

Most of the farming tutorials also include complete devices, including Tutorials/Egg farming and Tutorials/Cobblestone farming.  Many traps also use redstone.
