Sculk farming is a method of farming XP and/or sculk growth blocks for decoration by using the sculk catalyst block. Since mobs normally only drop XP when killed by a player, and sculk blocks drop XP when mined, this can also be used for bulk XP storage. However, you should also consider storing experience in furnaces.


== A few key points ==
As stated before, mobs only drop XP if killed by a player or tamed wolf, but if a mob dies near a sculk catalyst, regardless of how it dies, the catalyst will always produce sculk blocks, which can then be mined for XP.
Mobs will still drop their loot but not their XP. The amount the growth spreads depends on the amount of XP the mob is meant to drop.
When a mob that drops about the same XP as a zombie or a skeleton dies near enough to a sculk catalyst, the growth mainly focuses on a 3x3 area. This can be helpful for you to know how big you want your platform to be.
For more detailed information, see Sculk Growth.


== Components of a sculk farm ==
A mob farm which you can hook it up to.
A killing system and a cobblestone generator. The cobblestone will be converted into sculk.
A collection system for the sculk.
A bulk sculk storage system.
A reasonable AFK area for the player.
Optionally, a collection system (potentially the same system used for the sculk) for the mob drops of the farm.
