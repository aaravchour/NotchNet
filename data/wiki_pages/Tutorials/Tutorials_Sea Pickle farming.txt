This tutorial seeks to teach you how to farm sea pickles, which are bioluminescent animals that are naturally found underwater. They can be smelted into lime green dye or planted underwater to act as a light source.


== Properties ==
Sea pickles have interesting properties, which can be exploited to farm them. One pickle can be placed on live coral and then have bone meal applied. After one bone meal is applied, three more sea pickles will be placed in the same block. The application of more bone meal causes them to spread to nearby live coral blocks.


== Manual farming ==
Manually farming sea pickles can be done underwater near a coral reef. Simply apply bone meal on as many live coral blocks and sea pickle blocks as possible, and the player will soon have a lot of sea pickles.


== Semi-Automatic farming ==
To make the farming process easier, a dispenser can be hooked up to a fast redstone clock. This dispenser will apply bone meal to a water source block on top of a coral block. The coral is kept alive by the water above it. The player then plants and breaks the sea pickle accordingly.


== AFK farming ==
Farming sea pickles while AFK (away from keyboard) takes a bit of redstone. First, the player must plant a sea pickle underwater on top of a coral block. A dispenser puts bone meal on the sea pickle, causing it to multiply to 4 pickles. Then, the block underneath the pickles can be moved, or they are directly broken with a piston. The challenging part is that a block update detector cannot be used for this since water spontaneously causes block updates.


== Automatic farming ==
This takes advantage of the spreading mechanic of sea pickles. To build automatic sea pickle farms, have a dispenser apply bone meal to a block of 4 sea pickles, with another coral block nearby. The sea pickles will spread to this other coral block, which can be detected and broken.
