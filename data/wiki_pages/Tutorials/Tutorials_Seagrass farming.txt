This tutorial seeks to teach you how to farm seagrass, which are plants that are naturally found underwater.


== Mechanics ==
Seagrass spontaneously generates by applying bonemeal underwater. Applying bonemeal to seagrass will cause it to increase in height, similar to normal grass. This bonemeal can be applied by a dispenser, but the player can only obtain the item by breaking it with shears, making fully automatic farms impossible.


== Manual Farming ==
Seagrass can be manually farmed by applying bonemeal to as many underwater surfaces as possible. This will get seagrass for the player very quickly.


== AFK Farming ==
Seagrass is easily farmed by simply applying bonemeal to an underwater surface and then AFK-left clicking with shears. New shears can be given to the player as they break, allowing for continuous farming.
