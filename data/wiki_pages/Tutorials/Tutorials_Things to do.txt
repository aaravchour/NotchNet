== Surviving ==
If new, the player can dig down three blocks and block of the roof and put a torch to see, and when the player think it's day, they can break the top. If not, the player can block it of again. After being skilled enough to beat a raid, it is most recommended to always hold the totem of undying in your offhand to survive when the you died while still being able to hold another item but the totem still activates.


== Fire and related blocks ==
After a few iron ingots, the player should make a flint and steel to go to the Nether or cook food faster, or use it to burn other mobs later, but it is not recommended to burn a tree, because it will spread and cause more fire. The player should not use lava as it is more dangerous and will burn the item.


== Armor ==


=== The Nether ===
While going to the Nether, the player should replace their armor (specifically damaged armor) with new ones since it can break faster meaning the player will get more damage when fighting or any other damage.


=== The end ===
The player should bring at least diamond armor if not skilled enough, as the Ender dragon can knock the player off. Enchantments are recommended, but not needed. Feather falling can be really helpful when the Ender dragon knocks the player off a high place, such as the obsidian pillars and the player's tower to get up to the pillars.


== Villages ==


=== Popularity ===
If in a village and the iron golem is still there, the player should not hit any villagers or do any thing bad when near the iron golem because the iron golem will attack back. This is not a problem if the player killed the iron golem, but the villagers can spawn it again.


=== Taiga villages ===
If the player has weaker armor than iron or have no armor at all and is in a taiga village, the player can search for the armor stands with iron armor on them and take it, but doesn't when the player already has better armor, but the player can still take it just in case the player's armor breaks.


=== Curing ===
If want to bring a villager's price down without Hero of the Village, in hard or normal, the player zombify the villager and cure it by using a splash potion of weakness and a golden apple and wait about 5 minutes for it to turn back, and it will give the player discounts. Note a villager in normal have a 50% chance to die instead of zombifying.


=== Trading ===
The player should only trade good trade (e.g 32 sticks for an emerald, 11 glass panes for an emerald) unless the player is trying higher the levels or the player have a lot of those items for blocks. Bad ones such as a diamond for an emerald, 36, 25 34, etc, for one bell, while the bell is in the village. These are not recommended as the items required is more valuable and hard to get/obtain.


== Food ==
If running out of hunger, such as 6 hunger points () or with the hunger effect (), it is recommended to only eat when the hunger amount is lost as the exact same amount of the food the player has fills up to save more food later.
