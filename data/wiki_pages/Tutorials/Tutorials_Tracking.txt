(This tutorial refers to the skill of hunting down other players in Multiplayer Minecraft. To learn how to navigate in Minecraft, see Tutorials/Navigation.)
Tracking is a crucial skill in Minecraft. It is extremely helpful when attempting to get rid of other people that might be a threat to someone on a server. There are many methods of tracking in MInecraft. One common method is to use a map to locate other players, then go to them and hunt them down. In gamemodes such as Minecraft Manhunt, the hunter is given a compass to use to follow to track down the closest speedrunner.  Another very sneaky way is to find someone who is shifting underground without a map is to utilize the list of Minecraft players and their faces.
