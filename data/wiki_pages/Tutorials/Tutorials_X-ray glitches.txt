X-ray glitches allow the player to see certain features that are normally hidden behind blocks.


== Why bother? ==
X-ray glitches are useful for locating underground structures such as dungeons and mineshafts. They can also help you find end portal rooms once you are near a stronghold. If you are in the Nether, you can use x-ray glitches to locate fortresses and bastions.
Make sure that you're allowed to use this glitch in servers, though. For most servers, this can count as cheating because you can see the surroundings for mobs, loot chests or precious ores. If others catch you cheating, they can forbid you to do something or even ban you off the server.


== General approach ==
For time efficiency, the game only renders block surfaces if there is a transparent block between the surface and the player. For this purpose, transparent generally means that the player can see through the block, although lava is also transparent for this purpose. 
Normally, the camera is inside a transparent block, unless the player is suffocating, in which case the game renders blocks differently. However, it is possible for the camera to be inside a block, but the game does not register that the player is inside. In this case, the player "x-rays" through blocks immediately in the front.

=== Composter and gravity block method ===
Update: This no longer works as of Java version 1.18
This method works by putting the player into the crawl animation using a falling block while inside of a composter.
Video by Lewis

The method requires the following:

1 composter
1 of any solid falling block (Sand, gravel, and concrete powder all work)
To execute the glitch, simply position yourself inside of a composter and place the falling block above your head so it falls on top of the composter and puts you into the crawl position. It might be easier to see underground spaces if you dig a 1x1 hole downwards a few blocks before placing a composter down at the bottom and executing the glitch there.


== Bedrock Edition ==


=== Piston and slab method ===
This method works by pushing a slab into the player's head. Since slabs are partial blocks, the game does not consider the player to be inside a block. This trick has two main variants: One for looking upward and one for looking downward.
To x-ray upward, you need the following:

1 lever
2 redstone
1 piston
2 slab
It is recommended to have multiple slabs, so you can see more. The main setup is as follows, where everything is at head height:

Again, you may wish to surround your head with top slabs wherever possible, to maximize visibility. When you are ready, activate the lever, and the glitch will begin almost immediately.
To x-ray downward, you need the following:

1 lever
2 redstone
2 pistons
Several slabs
Several full blocks
This should include at least 1 sand or other gravity-affected block.
To set this up, start with the same setup as before, but place 2 pistons (1 at head height and one at foot height). The lower piston has a solid block in front, while the upper piston has a bottom slab. Surround yourself with additional blocks, with slabs on top, to maximize visibility. After you pull the lever, the x-ray glitch does not happen yet. Therefore, you can destroy the redstone, including the pistons, and surround yourself further. For the location that was the piston head, placing the full block is tricky, as you cannot look at a suitable surface. Instead, place the sand above where you want it to land, then place the slab as normal. When you are ready to trigger the glitch, enter sneak mode, and your eyes will lie below the top of the slab.


=== Falling snow method ===
This method works by gravity-affected blocks landing at the player's feet and piling up to the player's eye level. It can only be used to x-ray downward. You need the following materials:

1 sand (or other cubic, gravity-affected block)
4 top snow
Lots of slabs (optional, but increases visibility)
To begin, dig a 1-deep hole, and surround it with bottom slabs. Place a solid block above the hole, high enough that you can walk underneath. Next, place the sand on top, then stack the snow. Finally, stand in the hole, break the block, and enter sneaking.


=== Chain-lava method ===
This method allows you to X-ray through a lava sea in the Nether.

As many chains as desired.
All you need to do is place the chains sideways and you're done.


=== Pig method ===
Another X-ray hack  allows you to ride a pig in a 1 1/2 block high space. Place top slabs one block up from the floor, then ride a pig beneath them. This should glitch you into the ceiling. The only challenge about this hack is getting a pig down to the bedrock layer (which is most effective). It is easy to just push the pig down a shaft into a water landing at the bottom.


== Trivia ==
In Bedrock Edition the Stripe Lands may be considered an x-ray bug, in that they follow the same rules for what blocks are visible. This is why the sides of blocks do not always render.
