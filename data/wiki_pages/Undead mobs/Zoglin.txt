A zoglin is an undead hostile mob created when a hoglin enters the Overworld or End. It never retreats or flees, and attacks players and almost all non-zoglin mobs indiscriminately, using the same tusk attack as its non-zombified counterpart.


== Spawning ==
Zoglins spawn when a hoglin has been in the Overworld or the End for 300 game ticks (15 seconds). For their first 10 seconds after zombification, they get the   nausea effect. This nausea effect is cosmetic and does not affect its behavior.


== Drops ==
Adults and babies: 1–3 rotten flesh. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 6 with Looting III.
5 if adult and baby killed by a player or tamed wolf in Java Edition.
1–3 if adult killed by a player or tamed wolf in Bedrock Edition.


== Behavior ==
Zoglins are hostile toward armor stands, players in Survival or Adventure mode (except in Peaceful difficulty), and all mobs regardless of classification except creepers, ghasts, and other zoglins. This also extends to zombified piglins and hoglins.
When an adult zoglin attacks, it flings its target into the air. Blocking with shields does not mitigate this. When a baby zoglin attacks, they do not fling their target. Baby zoglins, unlike baby hoglins, never grow up. Any mob that can retaliate attacks a zoglin in return after being attacked.
In Java Edition adult zoglins attack once every two seconds and babies attack every second. In Bedrock Edition, both adults and babies attack once every second, making them more destructive compared to Java Edition, even on peaceful difficulty.
When a zoglin attacks a piglin, the piglin either retreats or fights back. Piglin brutes attack zoglins if they are attacked first and never retreat. They also attack the zoglin if the zoglin attacks a piglin or another piglin brute.
If a zoglin is fed crimson fungus before it is zombified, it does not despawn naturally and it doesn't count toward the mob cap.
Zoglins are incapable of breeding and do not flee from blocks that repel hoglins. Zoglins can be leashed. Unlike baby hoglins, baby zoglins attack baby zombified piglins. Piglins flee from zoglins if they are not engaged in combat.
In water, they sink to the bottom and wander about as if on dry land. They do not drown.
Being an undead mob, they are:

damaged by the status effect Instant Health and healed by the status effect Instant Damage,
unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison,
ignored by the wither (but still attempt to attack them however they deal no damage),
affected by the Smite enchantment.
Like zombified piglins, they are immune to fire and lava.
