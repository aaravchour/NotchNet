Giants are unused, over-sized mobs that look like zombies.


== Drops ==
A giant drops 5 when killed and has a chance of dropping some of its equipment if it has any.


== Spawning ==
No biome includes giants on their spawn lists, so they can never spawn naturally.
Additionally, giants simultaneously require a light level greater than 11 and less than 8. This effectively makes it impossible to make them appear through monster spawners.
Giants also have no spawn egg in the Creative inventory.


=== Commands ===
Giants can be spawned using commands such as /summon minecraft:giant.


== Behavior ==
Giants are close to 12 blocks tall, and it uses a six-times-enlarged zombie model.
Because giants are not actually undead, they do not burn in sunlight and they are damaged by potions of harming. Iron golems attack giants as they attack other hostile mobs.
Giants also do not convert into drowned when submerged in water. Instead, they slowly suffocate and die. 
Giants currently have no AI. The consequence of this is that they always face south when summoned, and they always stay that way, never wandering. They cannot turn their head, chase the player, or respond to damage. A giant can never receive knockback, and a giant's viewing direction can be changed only with commands or by shoving it into a minecart that faces a different direction.
Giants can move if ridden by another mob using NBT tags.


== Sounds ==
Giants use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

== History ==


== Issues ==
Giants are an unsupported mob and as such issues relating to them may not be fixed.


== Trivia ==
Because giants need to have a light level both less than 8 and greater than 11 to spawn, they don't spawn from monster spawners. However, this spawn condition can be bypassed with a custom monster spawner, if it attempts to spawn an entity with valid spawn conditions riding a giant.
If the player names a giant using a name tag, its name appears inside its head.
Changes made to the zombie model (for example, using a resource pack) change the giant's as well.
Notch mentioned Giant Zombies as a suggestion for a prefix mob along with other examples: "Burning Spider" and "Cobble Creeper" in a Bro-craft stream.
Notch removed the giants spawning capabilities because "they are too overpowered". He did not remove them entirely because "they are just too cool to remove".
If a giant is riding a minecart, it hovers way above it.
If a mob is riding a giant, unless it's a large slime or magma cube, a ghast, or the ender dragon, it is hidden inside the giant's head.
Players are unable to attack a giant's head and torso unless they are positioned near the bottom of the giant. Projectiles such as arrows can hit these areas as normal.
Giants, being capable of dealing 26 × 13 to 75 × 37.5, and having 100 × 50 health, are capable of killing players without armor in one hit even in Easy difficulty.
Killing a giant cannot give the player the Monster Hunter Advancement.
