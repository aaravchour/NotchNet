The main purpose of brewing stands is to allow for the brewing of potions. Its interface can be opened by pressing use on them.
Brewing stands need blaze powder as fuel. Each piece brews 20 batches of potions, with each stage of brewing counting separately. Unlike furnaces, there is no time limit; fuel is consumed only when there are bottles and an ingredient to brew into it.
Brewing stands interact with hoppers as follows:

They accept brewing ingredients from hoppers pointing down into the top.
Any valid potion recipe can be preloaded for "hands-free" brewing of a complex recipe, with the nether wart falling through into the stand for the first step.
Bottles and fuel are accepted from hoppers pointing into the side.
Finished products can be pulled out by hoppers below, but each stage of brewing counts as a batch of "finished" potions.
In Minecraft Education, elements can be combined in the brewing stand to make the medicine potions: antidote, elixir, eye drops, and tonic.


=== Changing profession ===
If a village has a brewing stand that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who hasn't already picked a job site block in the village has a chance to change their profession into cleric.

In Java Edition, when a brewing stand is broken, particles from a bottle appear, even if no bottle is in the stand.

According to Searge, for thematic reasons, a brewing stand was added to the basement of the igloo. Because of this, blaze powder was required for fuel to preserve game progression. In this way, the player is prevented from using it before going to the Nether.
