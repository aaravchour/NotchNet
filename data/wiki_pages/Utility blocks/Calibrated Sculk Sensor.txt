A calibrated sculk sensor is a craftable variant of sculk sensor. Similarly to its counterpart it detects vibrations, but with twice the range, and can detect multiple vibrations in quicker succession. It outputs a signal on all sides except for its input, which can receive power to make the sensor only listen to specific vibrations, depending on the input signal strength.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Calibrated sculk sensors can be broken with any tool, but can be broken faster with a hoe. They drop experience when broken. When broken by an item that is enchanted with Silk Touch, a calibrated sculk sensor drops itself.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
Unlike regular sculk sensors, there are a few differences:

Calibrated sculk sensors can detect vibrations up to 16 blocks away.
Calibrated sculk sensors have a cooldown of 1 second instead of 2 seconds.
Calibrated sculk sensors' "Sensor" could be disabled by a redstone signal onto its crystallized side.


=== Redstone ===
The same with the sculk sensor, one side of the calibrated sculk sensor can receive a redstone signal as an input, and the strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the sculk sensor will listen to. The following list showcases (in order) a list of frequencies that the calibrated sculk sensor can listen for.

 Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
 Landing on any surface (land or water)
 Using an item (casting a fishing pole, throwing a snowball, etc.)
 Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
 Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
 Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
 Mobs and players getting damaged
 Consuming items (drinking and eating)
 Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
 Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
 Blocks changing (adding food to campfire, etc, like an observer)
 Non-wool blocks being destroyed
 Non-wool blocks being placed
 Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
 Mobs and players dying or an explosion
