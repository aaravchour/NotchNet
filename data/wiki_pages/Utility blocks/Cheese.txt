Cheese is a joke food and a block that can be eaten by the player. It was added in the April Fools snapshot 23w13a_or_b.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Cheese drops itself if it has not been bitten. Once the cheese is bitten, it cannot be recollected even with the use of Silk Touch.


=== Natural generation ===
Cheese generates naturally in the Moon dimension.


=== Mob loot ===
Upon death, Moon Cows drop 0-2 cheese. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 cheese blocks with Looting III.


=== Bucket ===
If the "Instacheese from Buckets" vote is active, using a milk bucket on the ground places cheese, similarly to powder snow. However, it cannot be picked up again via the bucket.


== Usage ==
Similar to cakes, cheese can be eaten when placed in the world. However, unlike cakes, the cheese blocks is divided into 8 smaller cubes. Clicking on one of them eats only the selected part, unlike cakes, where slices cannot be chosen.
Eating cheese not only restores hunger but also oxygen, allowing the player to survive on the Moon.


== Appearence ==
Cheese shares a similar texture to End Stone; however, it is desaturated in colour.

== Issues ==
Cheese blocks are an unsupported item due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed.


== Trivia ==
The cheese block has same texture as the end stone but slightly darker.
The cheese block is based on the "Moon being made of cheese" theory.
