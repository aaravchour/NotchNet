A fletching table is a fletcher's job site block that can generate naturally in villages. The fletching table is used to turn an unemployed villager into a fletcher.


== Obtaining ==


=== Natural generation ===
Fletching tables can generate naturally inside fletcher houses in villages.

== Usage ==
The fletching table currently has no right-click functionality; though, if right-clicked in spectator mode, it shows the crafting table interface for a split second. It is most likely that its functionality will be added in upcoming updates.


=== Changing profession ===
If a village has a fletching table that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who hasn't already picked a job site block has a chance to change their profession to fletcher.


=== Fuel ===
Fletching tables can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

Fletching tables can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
