A grindstone is a block that repairs items and tools as well as removing enchantments from them, except for curses. It also serves as a weaponsmith's job site block.


== Obtaining ==


=== Breaking ===
Grindstones can be obtained using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.


=== Natural generation ===

Grindstones naturally generate at village weaponsmiths.


=== Crafting ===


== Usage ==
A grindstone can be oriented in different directions. In Java Edition it doesn't need a supporting block. In Bedrock Edition it breaks if unsupported.


=== Repairing and disenchanting ===

When used, an interface is displayed with two input slots and one output slot.
Placing one enchanted item in an input slot forms a new non-enchanted item of the same type and durability in the output slot. Removing the item from the output slot consumes the input item and drops some experience.
Placing two items (enchanted or not) of the same type in the input slots forms a new non-enchanted item of that type and with a durability equal to the sum of the durabilities of the two input items, plus 5% of the maximum durability of that item (rounded down), up to its maximum durability. Both input items are consumed in the process. If either input item was enchanted, then removing the output item drops some experience.
The amount of experience dropped depends on the number of enchantments and levels of each, but it is partially random. For example, Fire Protection I gives 5-9 experience.
As with all non-enchanted items, the new item has no prior work penalty. A grindstone cannot remove a curse. Grindstones also do not remove an item's custom name.
If the action is not applicable (e.g. only one non-enchanted item, or the two inputs are different items), the arrow displays a red cross like that of an anvil and no item appears in the output slot.
The following tables show the durability bonuses of various items:


=== Changing profession ===
If a village has a grindstone that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who did not already pick a job site block has a chance to change their profession into weaponsmith.


=== Experience ===
When removing enchantments from items, the player gains experience equal to the minimum modified enchantment level of that enchantment. The final amount is a uniformly-distributed random amount between half the resulting sum (rounded up) and the sum itself.


=== Piston interactivity ===
Grindstones cannot be pushed by pistons or pulled by sticky pistons.

== Trivia ==
Before the grindstone was added, a different method to remove enchantments was floated for Update Aquatic, which would have been by means of feeding items to a mob known as "the Great Hunger", but the mob lost the MINECON Earth 2017 mob vote to the phantom.
