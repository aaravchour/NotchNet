== Trivia ==
Iron corrodes in salt water way faster than it does in water, because electrochemistry is involved.
The ingredients of the heat block corresponds to the contents of hand warmers. A hand warmer generates heat due to the same electrochemistry that rusts iron in seawater, but with powdered iron the effect becomes more appreciable.
