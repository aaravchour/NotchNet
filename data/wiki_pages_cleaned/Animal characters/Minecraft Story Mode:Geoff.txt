Geoff, also called "Geoffy", is a minor character in Minecraft: Story Mode Season 2 and is a Mooshroom/Cow. He first appeared in "Jailhouse Block" and is the pet of Oxblood.

Geoff looks like an ordinary mooshroom, with a red coat and white spots, mushrooms on his back and head, and with black eyes. If he is sheared, he becomes a cow.

Geoff seems to like people, as him getting along with Jesse and Oxblood. However, after he was sheared, he seems to no longer recognize anyone.

Geoff is the first and only mooshroom seen in Minecraft: Story Mode.
He is the only character whose species can determinately be changed.
