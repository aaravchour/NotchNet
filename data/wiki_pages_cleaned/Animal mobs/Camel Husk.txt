A camel husk is an undead passive mob that was added in Mounts of Mayhem. It is an undead variant of the camel and can be ridden by husk or parched, forming a camel husk jockey.

Camel husks usually spawn in deserts, at light level of 0. They sometimes spawn with a husk wielding an iron spear and a parched riding on it, forming a camel husk jockey. Camel husk jockies always appear hostile.
When the husk and parched rider is killed, the camel husk becomes passive.
Camel husks do not spawn in peaceful difficulity, despite being classified as passive. Baby camel husks do not spawn naturally and can only be summoned via /summon minecraft:camel_husk ~ ~ ~ {IsBaby:1}.

Camel husks drop 2-3 rotten fleshes upon death by a player or tamed wolf.

Like camels, camel husks can be saddled and ridden; however, they cannot be bred. They can be fed and healed with rabbit's foot.
Unlike most undead mobs, camel husks are not targeted by iron golems and snow golems. However, camel husk jockey riders are targeted.
Camel husks have the unique ability to step up 1.5 block-high walls, unlike other mounts such as horses, which can automatically step up one block without jumping. This allows camels to step onto fences and walls, among other things.

Like any undead mobs:

Are damaged by Instant Health and healed by Instant Damage;
Are not affected by Regeneration and Poison;
Take extra damage from Smite enchantment.
Are not targeted by the wither.
Causes an armadillo to hide in its shell.
Like husks and parcheds, camel husks do not burn in sunlight.

Camel husks can be ridden by players. Up to two players can ride one camel. While riding, the player in the back seat cannot hurt the player riding or the camel husk itself.
Camel husks have one slot in their inventory, to put a  Saddle on it. A saddle can be placed on a camel by holding it and then using it on the camel, or by accessing its inventory. A camel's inventory can be accessed by mounting the camel and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the "open inventory" button on the camel.
Saddled camel husks can float on water when being ridden by a player or by a mob.

Camel husks only have one slot available:

 Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.
Saddles can be placed on a camel husks by holding it and then using on the camel husk, or by accessing its inventory. A camel husk's inventory can be accessed by mounting the it and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using on it.
Baby camel husks cannot be equipped.

Camel husks share a similar texture to the camel; however, they appear a bit darker in color. Their ribs can be seen on their bodies.
