Donkeys are variants of horses that, when tamed, can be ridden and equipped with chests.

1-4 donkeys spawn in plains and only 1 in savannas. Donkeys also spawn in meadows. 20% of the individual donkeys spawn as foals.

2-6 donkeys spawn only in plains at light level 7 or above.

Adult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Foals start at half the size of adults and in Bedrock Edition, get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike wolves and cats, the appearances of donkeys do not change once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment.
Donkeys are smaller all around than the normal horses and sport long, erect ears. Their manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks. All donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails. Donkeys can be equipped with a simple saddle, not the full covered armor and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items.
Unlike almost all other mobs, donkeys with equipped saddles or chests do not render these when under the effect of Invisibility.

Upon death, donkeys drop:

02 Leather. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.
13, when killed by a player or tamed wolf.
If equipped with a chest or saddle, they drop those items. They also drop the contents of the chest.
Upon successful breeding, 18 is dropped.
Killing a baby donkey yields no items nor experience.

Tamed and saddled donkeys are some of the fastest means of transportation or hauling in the game, although they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences, which the player can't generally.
Donkeys cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.
Donkeys can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals. They can also be pulled along and tied up using a lead.

Tamed donkeys can have the following slot available:

 Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.
 An additional 15 inventory slots, provided the donkey has been equipped with a chest.
Equipment can be placed on a donkey by holding left shift and then using on the donkey, or by accessing its inventory. A donkeys inventory can be accessed by mounting the donkey and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the "open inventory" button on the donkey.
A donkey can be equipped with a chest by using a chest on a donkey. The chest cannot be removed except by killing the donkey, which causes the chest and its contents to drop.
Foals cannot be equipped with anything.

Once a donkey is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the dismount control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a donkey.
A ridden saddled donkey automatically runs up any one block high slope. The donkey and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The donkey itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. They cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.
Unlike horses, all spawned donkeys have the same movement speed and jump strength, although speed potions can be used on the donkey and travel via the Nether can make the donkey easily the pack animal with the fastest practical way to travel in Minecraft. Donkeys are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.
Ridden saddled donkeys have the ability of "jumping charging". When the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled donkey can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Donkeys are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.

Donkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. A donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near. Any donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves. Donkeys remain passive, even when hit.
Donkeys occasionally emit an audible braying sound.
Adult Donkeys, unlike most mobs, cannot ride in a minecart and boat. Foals, however, can. Unlike other passive mobs, donkeys slowly regenerate health.

Adult donkeys can be tamed. With an empty hand, mount it repeatedly; when it shows hearts and no longer bucks the player, it is tamed. It is necessary to tame a donkey in order to breed it, give it equipment, or ride it for any length of time. 
Taming depends on the donkey's "temper". They begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the donkey, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The donkey becomes tamed if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.
While riding an untamed donkey, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid. This gives a general idea of the donkey's speed. It is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.
Like all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed.

Feeding tamed donkeys golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode.
The offspring appear more spindly than their adult versions and grow progressively larger with time until they reach their full size. The offspring do not automatically belong to the player who owns their parents. Rather, it is born as an untamed donkey and must be tamed after it grows into an adult. The foal can be fed to make it mature faster.
Breeding two donkeys creates a donkey foal. Because all donkeys have the same texture, the offspring looks exactly like its parents when it is fully grown.
Cross-breeding a donkey with a horse creates a mule foal. Mules cannot breed.

Feeding a donkey food may alter its behavior and cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and restore its health.
To feed a donkey, hold a valid food item and press use while looking at it. If the food is invalid, the action is treated as an attempt to mount the donkey. Donkeys can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. The table below lists the effects of the various foods donkeys can consume.

All donkeys have three "equine stats" that vary between donkeys: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the donkey is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.

When spawned in any way except breeding  for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs  donkeys are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.

Donkey's health ranges from 1530, but tends toward the average 2223. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A donkey with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not display the last half-heart. If the donkey has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.

A spawned donkey's speed value is always 0.175, but it only moves at the slightly reduced 7.38 blocks/sec. For reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1, equivalent to 4.3 blocks/sec. and the player's sprinting speed is equivalent to 5.6 blocks/sec. The speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.
A bred donkey's speed value has the same limits as other horses, between 0.1125 and 0.3375. See Horse#Movement speed.
See transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.

A spawned donkey's jump strength is always 0.5, enough to clear 1 916 blocks. A bred donkey's jump strength has the same limits as other horses, between 0.4 and 1.0. See Tutorials/Horses#Speed.

When breeding two donkeys, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined the same way horses' stats are.

Issues relating to "Donkey" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

If a player picks up leather dropped by an adult donkey, they receive the "Cow Tipper" achievement. This is due to the achievement being given when a player picks up any piece of leather instead of being given when killing a cow.
A player riding a donkey is dragged along if the donkey is being pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted up in the air in the same way.
Using commands, it is possible to make a donkey with no armor slot, but also no way to equip a chest.
In the Bedrock Edition, the donkey can be transported in a boat by riding the donkey and jumping into the boat then dismounting (leaving the donkey behind in the boat) and activating the boat from underneath/underwater. Attempting to activate the boat to pilot it from above results in the player being mounted on the donkey again rather than being placed inside the boat to pilot it.
