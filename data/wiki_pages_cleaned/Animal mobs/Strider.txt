Striders are passive mobs native to the Nether. They can walk on lava, and be saddled and ridden by the player. A warped fungus on a stick is needed to control a strider, similar to how a pig is controlled by a carrot on a stick.

Striders can spawn in every Nether biome. Two to four striders spawn on spaces of lava that have an air block above. In Java Edition, striders are the only passive mob in the Nether, so spawning attempts are made every 400 game ticks. In Bedrock Edition, striders share the animal population cap with hoglins and their spawn rate depends on biome, being impacted by the ability of other mobs to spawn at a given coordinate.
For every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional baby strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. This behavior is limited to one strider. A baby strider on the adult strider continues to grow although it does not dismount the adult strider once it has grown up. 
Zombified piglins have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider. If this happens, the strider spawns with a saddle and the zombified piglin spawns carrying a warped fungus on a stick. The zombified piglin does not despawn naturally, and does not count towards the mob cap. On Peaceful difficulty, the zombified piglin despawns immediately, leaving a saddled strider.
If a strider spawns under lava, it rises out of the lava. in Bedrock Edition, baby striders spawn more commonly than adult striders do, including when spawned by a spawn egg.

Adult striders drop 25 string upon death. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 28 with Looting III.
Striders wearing a saddle always drop the saddle upon death, regardless of whether they spawn wearing it or a player put it on them. Saddles can be retrieved by right-clicking the strider with shears, or by killing the strider. When an adult strider is killed by a player or tamed wolf, 12 / 13 experience is dropped.

Lava does not damage striders. Unlike most mobs, striders can walk on top of lava without sinking. Upon being harmed by another mob, striders attempt to flee for a few seconds while making "retreat" noises. Striders are damaged by water, rain, and splash water bottles, which deal damage by 1 per splash water bottle or half-second in water or rain, which can kill them. While in water, they slowly sink while taking damage. Striders still take damage from rain even if they are in lava. However, they are not harmed when standing in a filled cauldron. They are not harmed by snowfall or snowballs. They take extra damage from freezing in powder snow.
Unlike piglins and hoglins, striders can exist safely in the Overworld, as long as they are kept away from water and rain. Unlike some other mobs, striders do not zombify when leaving the Nether. Striders outside of lava change to a dull purple color, change their expression to more of a frown, shiver, and their legs become slightly shorter. They also move slower when outside of lava. 
If a strider has the Speed effect applied to it, the strider moves faster on both land and lava (though its land speed is still considerably slow). If a zombified piglin is riding a strider, the strider pursues the player if the zombified piglin is angered.
Due to a bug, striders that fall from a height take fall damage when landing in lava source blocks. This does not occur for striders that fall into flowing lava. A baby strider on an adult strider still grows into an adult. Apart from this, adult striders riding other adult striders do not spawn naturally. Baby striders not riding on an adult follow the closest adult strider.

The player can ride on an adult strider using a saddle. 
Similar to how pigs are controlled using a carrot on a stick, striders move forward automatically while their direction is influenced using a warped fungus on a stick, at a speed of 4.14 m/s if on a flat lava surface (such as the Nether lava sea) or 1.74 m/s if on land. They walk especially slowly against the lava flow direction.
Warped fungus on a stick can be used, causing the strider to boost and walk at a greater speed and taking 1 point of durability from the warped fungus on a stick. They also follow players holding a warped fungus or a warped fungus on a stick. 
Unlike underwater boats, players riding striders into lava (for example, getting into flowing-only from heights or horizons, static lava from horizons) do not dismount if the strider submerges into the lava, and striders slowly rise back up to the surface if this happens. However, players risk getting burned by the lava while submerged. However, in Java Edition, players cannot start riding a strider that is fully submerged within the lava.
When ridden over land, striders automatically walk up any one block high slope. They also cross any 1-wide block gap or air space that is only one block higher - diagonally up - when ridden directly upward and not completely sideways to the slope.
To safely dismount from a strider, a player who does not have Fire Resistance may face a solid block within reach before dismounting to dismount onto that block, instead of at the strider's location (which is usually in lava).
Striders can still be equipped with a saddle while another mob is riding it.

If striders are given warped fungus, they breed to create baby striders, granting the player 17 experience orbs. The parent striders have a cooldown of about 5 minutes before they can breed again. All babies obtained through breeding take 20 minutes to grow up. The growth of baby striders can be slowly accelerated using warped fungus; each use takes 10% off of the remaining time to grow up.

Issues relating to "Strider" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

Striders had a fin in their texture file. The fin wasn't visible in-game and was removed in 20w15a.
If commands are used to saddle a baby strider, and the player rides the baby strider, the player takes fire damage due to not being high enough to avoid the lava.
Mojang added striders to the game as the solution to the community request for lava boats.
At one point in the strider's development, before it was added to the game, a strider out of lava would retract its legs and start to take damage while bouncing around until it died, similar to how fish suffocate when out of water. This feature was discarded for being "too sad".
Striders were planned to have their own unique armor and saddle, but this was decided against.
Striders were initially going to have a long tongue with which they could eat things, not too dissimilar to a current frogs. The different items would all have various effects, such as swords hurting the strider, and TNT exploding.
Part of the reason that striders drop string (from their bristles) was to answer the question of "how do piglins make crossbows?".
In Minecraft Legends:Return of the Piglins, striders shed the strings which piglins used to make crossbows.
The bobbing animation that the strider makes while walking was initially an accident. However, the developers thought it was "quirky and fun", so it was added as a feature.
