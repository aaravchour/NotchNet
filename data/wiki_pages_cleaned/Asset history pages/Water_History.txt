Every frame, for each position in the still water texture array, the respective values for soup_heat, pot_heat and flame_heat are calculated as detailed below:

Calculates a local_soup_heat equal to the sum of the 3x1 soup_heat neighborhood around the current element.
Calculates the new soup_heat as the sum of the local_soup_heat divided by 3.3F plus the pot_heat times 0.8F
Calculates the new pot_heat as the current pot_heat plus the flame_heat times 0.05. pot_heat is clamped to a minimum of 0.
Calculates the new flame_heat as the current flame_heat minus 0.1F.
However, there is a 0.05 in 1 random chance that flame_heat is set to 0.5.
Once the above arrays have been updated, for each pixel in the water texture, the color and alpha values are calculated based on soup_heat:

Calculates a color_heat as the soup_heat clamped between 0 and 1 inclusive.
Then it calculates the color components of the pixel as follows:
float red = 32 + color_heat^2 * 32
float green = 50 + color_heat^2 * 64
float blue = 255
float alpha = 146 + color_heat^2 * 50
The red, green and blue values are then converted to bytes and assigned to the texture accordingly.

In addition, the flowing water texture also uses a spatial translation to give the appearance of movement. This transformation moves the flowing water texture downwards by one pixel after a fixed amount of time, wrapping the bottom layer of the texture back to the top.
