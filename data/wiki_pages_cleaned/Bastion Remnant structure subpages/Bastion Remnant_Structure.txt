Looks like an open piglin mouth - with "Bridge" being "tongue" - golden (if mini-)hoglin and "drop-of 'drool'," coming-off that part of that. Symbolic (but of what?).

The hoglin stables consist of a three-part rampart with damaged hoglin stables on either side. Hoglin stables' pieces are contained in the subfolder hoglin_stable. They contain the hoglin stable chests.

The housing unit consists of multiple ruined two-part ramparts arranged around a central courtyard with nether wart growing in the middle. Housing unit pieces are contained in the subfolder units.

The player can get many great drops from the chests such as netherite scraps or ancient debris.
It is also very likely that you will find in generic chests spectral arrows (11,2%), arrows (54,6%), magma cream (44,1%), chains (24,4%), bone block (24,4%), gold ingot (19%), block of gold (19%) and the pigstep music disc (2.27%)
