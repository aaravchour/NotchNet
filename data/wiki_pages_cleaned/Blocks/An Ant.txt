An ant is a joke block introduced in Java Edition 20w14 that moves around when placed on top of black or white concrete.

An ant cannot be obtained as an item even by using the /give command. An ant can be placed using commands such as /fill or /setblock, and naturally generates in the "ant" dimension. It cannot be destroyed by tools or explosions.

One ant block naturally generates in the "ant" dimension, where it begins moving immediately.
One ant block naturally generates in the "skygrid" dimension, however it does not move

An ant simulates Langton's ant. If placed on top of black or white concrete, it will move in a deterministic pattern, turning the concrete underneath it into its other variation. The ant block is the Turing machine mentioned in the update's changelog.
If two ant blocks collide, they will merge into one. It cannot be pushed by pistons, and is blast resistant, and can remove bedrock.
If a block below the ant block gets broken, the ant will stop moving. Therefore, you can stop its movement in survival by blowing it up with beds.

An Ant blocks are an unsupported item due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed.
