A block of gold is a precious metal block equivalent to nine gold ingots.

Ocean monuments have a central room containing 8 blocks of gold encased in dark prismarine.
Blocks of gold generate as part of ruined portals and bastion remnants in varying quantities.

Blocks of gold can only be mined with an iron pickaxe or better.

Blocks of gold are a compact way to store gold ingots.

Blocks of gold can be used to "power" a beacon. The beacon can be powered by a 33 square of gold blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 55, 77 and 99 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely gold blocks, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of emerald, blocks of netherite, and blocks of diamond.

Blocks of gold can be placed under note blocks to produce bell sounds.

Piglins become distracted upon the player dropping a block of gold as an item, and become enraged if the player breaks a block of gold near them.

In Xbox 360 Edition, before TU19, four gold blocks stacked on top of an obsidian block could be found inside the tutorial world's desert pyramid. This is a reference to Achievement Hunter's Let's Play Minecraft series, in which this combination is used to create the "Tower of Pimps" (seen right), a structure first created by Gavin Free, which is now used in many episodes as a trophy.
If one block is considered to be equal to one cubic meter, then one block of gold has a mass of 19,320 kilograms or 42,593 pounds, making it the heaviest real-world matter available in vanilla Minecraft if element blocks are not considered. A player's inventory has 37 slots (including the offhand slot), and each can carry 64 gold blocks; therefore, a player can carry a maximum number of 45,749.76 metric tons of weight, not considering armor or putting things in shulker boxes (theoretically increasing the weight by 27 times).
