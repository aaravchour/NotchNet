Bone blocks are storage blocks equivalent to nine pieces of bone meal. 

Bone blocks are generated naturally as part of fossil structures found in desert and swamp biomes. They also generate as part of nether fossils in soul sand valley biomes.

Bone blocks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.

Bone blocks are decorative blocks, and can also be used as compact storage for bone meal.

Bone blocks can be placed under note blocks to produce xylophone sounds.
