A copper bars is a copper variant block that acts similarly to iron bars, and oxidizes like normal copper blocks.

Copper bars can be broken with any pickaxe. Otherwise, it drops nothing.

Copper bars shares the same functionality as its iron counterpart.

Like most copper blocks, unwaxed copper bars undergo 4 stages of oxidation:

Unoxidized - Normal stage
Exposed
Weathered
Oxidized
Only lightning and axes can reverse the oxidation process. Using a honeycomb on an unwaxed copper bars prevents the oxidation.

The crafting recipe for the copper bars was originally made for copper trapdoors since the Tricky Trials update.
