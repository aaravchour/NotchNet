A copper bulb is a light-emitting block and a transparent block. It is made of copper and therefore oxidizes over time.

Copper bulbs can be broken with stone pickaxes and any pickaxes higher than that. Mine the copper bulbs with anything else would drop nothing.

Copper bulbs can be found in a random state (lit on or off, any oxidation) in the trial chambers.

Copper bulbs can be turned into the respective waxed copper blocks by using a honeycomb item on them. Waxed copper bulbs do not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.

Using an axe on a waxed copper bulb turns it into the respective non-waxed copper bulb. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized copper bulb reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper bulb respectively.

Non-waxed copper bulbs are completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed copper bulbs nearby are deoxidized randomly.

Copper bulbs are redstone components that emit light while triggered. A comparator can read the state of a copper bulb. They also work as a T-flip-flop.
