A copper chain is a copper variant block that was added in The Copper Age. It is similar to chains and oxidizes like most copper blocks.

Copper chains can be broken with any pickaxe. Otherwise, it drops nothing.

Copper chains function like its iron counterpart.

Like normal copper blocks, unwaxed copper chains undergo 4 stages of oxidation:

Unoxidized - Normal stage
Exposed
Weathered
Oxidized
Only lightning and axes can revert the oxidation process. Using a honeycomb on an unwaxed copper chain prevents the oxidation.
