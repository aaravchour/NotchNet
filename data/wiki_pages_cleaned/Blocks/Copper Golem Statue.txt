Copper golem statues are created when a copper golem gets fully oxidized. It will freeze in any pose and drop any items that it holds.

Copper Golem Statues can change its pose by interacting with it. It cycles through four poses:

Standing - Normal/Default
Sitting
Running
Star

Like most copper blocks, unwaxed copper golem statues undergo 4 stages of oxidation:

Unoxidized - Normal stage
Exposed
Weathered
Oxidized
Only lightning and axes can reverse the oxidation process. Using a honeycomb on an unwaxed copper golem statue prevents the oxidation.
Using an axe on an unwaxed unoxidized copper golem statue reverts it back to a normal unwaxed unoxidized copper golem.

Redstone Comparators can read the state of a copper golem statue. It emits a redstone signal strength based on its pose.
