A copper lantern is a copper variant block that was added in The Copper Age. Like normal lanterns, it gives off light when exposed to darkness and oxidizes like most copper blocks.

Copper lanterns can be easily broken by hand, but using any pickaxe can break it faster.

A copper lantern also drop as an item if:

The attachment block is removed or destroyed.
Water or lava flows into it.
a piston tries to push it or moves a block into its space.

Like lanterns, copper lanterns can be placed on top or bottom portion of any solid blocks.

Like most copper blocks, unwaxed copper lanterns undergo 4 stages of oxidation:

Unoxidized - Normal stage
Exposed
Weathered
Oxidized
Only lightning and axes can reverse the oxidation process. Using a honeycomb on an unwaxed copper lantern prevents oxidation.
