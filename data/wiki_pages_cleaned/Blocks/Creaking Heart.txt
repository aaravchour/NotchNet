A Creaking heart is a "living" block that rarely generates in natural pale oak trees of the pale garden. This block summons and puppeteers the creaking, when it is active in the night.

The Creaking heart can be broken using any tool, however the axe is the quickest. It can be obtained using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, otherwise it drops 1-3 resin clumps; Fortune can increase the maximum drops by 1 per level (up to 6 with Fortune 3).
Destroying a naturally-generated creaking heart drops 20-24 experience, only in Survival mode.

The creaking heart can be activated by placing a creaking heart between 2 pale oak logs, which will spawn creaking at night as long as there is a valid spawn area in a 32 block radius of the creaking heart. The creaking heart also generates resin clumps on nearby pale oak logs upon a player hitting the creaking spawned by the creaking heart.
