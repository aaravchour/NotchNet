A decorated pot is an ornamental block crafted from pottery sherds or bricks.

Decorated pots can be broken with any tool and are mined instantly. A decorated pot drops the four pottery sherds or bricks used to craft it when mined with a pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe or sword not enchanted with Silk Touch. It drops itself when mined with anything else, including tools listed above enchanted with Silk Touch.
A decorated pot drops itself if pushed by a piston. It also always drops itself when destroyed by an explosion, similar to other precious blocks such as beacons and shulker boxes.

The decorated pot's side textures will correspond to what item is used in the crafting. If a pottery sherd is used, that side will have the texture of that pottery sherd, if a brick is used, that side will have the default texture. The pottery sherd or brick within the 8th slot (bottom most) of the crafting grid determines the texture that faces against the player upon placement; the 2nd, 4th, 6th slots will determine the textures of the back/left/right facings in accordance to the player's POV.

Decorated pots are used for decoration. Due to the top part of the decorated pot having no collision, other blocks can be placed on top of them, including other decorated pots and regular flower pots, which are required to place a flower in the decorated pot.
In the 1.20.3 snapshots and pre-releases, decorated pots can hold a single stack of any one item type. Using an item on a decorated pot puts it in the pot. The pot shakes if the player uses the pot with an empty hand or an item that can't be placed in the pot. Punching or shattering a decorated pot drops any items that were held inside.

Decorated pots will switch to the shattered sounds immediately before breaking when destroyed by a non-Silk Touch tool.
