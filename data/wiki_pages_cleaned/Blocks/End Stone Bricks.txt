End stone bricks are an end stone-based brick.

End stone bricks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

End stone bricks can be found naturally as part of the structure of end cities.

End stone bricks are primarily decorative blocks, similarly to other brick-type blocks.
Like raw end stone, end stone bricks have a blast resistance stronger than most other stone variants, except bedrock and obsidian. However, unlike end stone, end stone bricks can be destroyed by the ender dragon.

End stone bricks can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sound.
