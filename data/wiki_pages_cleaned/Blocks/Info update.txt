info_update and info_update2 are debugging/placeholder blocks exclusive to Bedrock Edition that generated in place of blocks that are not yet added.

These blocks can no longer be obtained. They used to generate instead of magma blocks when a player with a lower version of the game where the block had not been added joined a player with a higher one.

It's usage is unknown, however it could be like the unknown block, but instead of incorrect ID of add-ons,  it could be of a vanilla block that still doesn't exist in the version of the game

The block's texture is shared by reserved6 and unknown.
