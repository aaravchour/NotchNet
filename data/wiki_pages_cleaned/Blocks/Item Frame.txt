An item frame is an entity or block entity that displays the item or block that is inside it.
A glow item frame keeps itself and the item inside it illuminated, even in the dark.

In Java Edition, an empty item frame can be broken simply by punching it. If the item frame contains an item, punching it drops the item, leaving the frame on the wall.
Because item frames are entities in Java Edition, they can be broken in Adventure mode. They will also be targeted by commands using the @e selector.

An item frame containing a pair of elytra generates in each end ship.

Expert-level cartographer villagers have a chance to sell an item frame for 7 emeralds.

Item frames can be placed on the sides of cactus blocks, pressure plates, fences, trees, slabs, cobblestone walls, chests, doors, and all solid blocks. They can also be placed on the top and bottom of these blocks. To place on chests and doors, the player needs to be sneaking. As item frames are an entity, multiple item frames can occupy the same block, although on different faces. It also allows non-solid blocks to occupy the same space.
Players can place items in the frame by using the item. If a map is placed in an item frame, it enlarges to show the map in the size of a full block, with the item frame's location displayed as a green pointer on the map, pointing in the direction the item frame is facing. If this is done in the Nether, the green cursor spins around similar to the white cursor (players). If an item in an item frame has been renamed using an anvil, it displays its custom name when the cursor is over the item frame. If the player places a block inside the frame, it is displayed in miniature half in, half out of the block. This can be most notably seen on stairs or slabs.
Pick block may be used on item frames by players in creative mode only, the control has no effect for players in Survival or Adventure mode. When the item frame is displaying an item, pick block picks the displayed item instead of the item frame.
Item frames can be placed on the lid of a shulker box that is positioned horizontally, but pop off when the lid is opened.

The displayed item can then be rotated by right-clicking the frame. Items displayed in the item frame can turn 45 diagonally, with a total of 8 possibilities (90 and 4 possibilities if it is a map), and the frame outputs a redstone signal depending on the rotation phase that can be interpreted by a redstone comparator (note that this rotation value is separate from the clock or compass rotation). As long as the frame remains placed, it remembers the orientation of the last item it held, and uses it for the next item it holds.

When an item is placed inside a glow item frame, it appears to glow, even though it does not emit any light level.

Item frames and glow item frames share the same sounds.

The item frame is based upon a suggestion on Reddit, like the ender chest and flower pot.
The item frame is the only entity to reference a block model. Because of this, the texture of the frame border is the same as the birch planks texture.
Item frame is the only placeable item that can interfere with other non-full block entities.
Due to the way layer textures are displayed in Minecraft, maps float on item frames, similar to how icons float on the map itself.
