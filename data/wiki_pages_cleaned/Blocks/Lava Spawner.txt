The lava spawner was a block that would repeatedly create lava on each of its four orthogonal sides.

Lava spawners can be broken instantly, regardless of held items.

Lava spawners could be found in Indev House chests in stacks of 99 in in-20100124-2, and stacks of 100 in in-20100128. Prior to this, they were added to the player's inventory by default in a stack of 5.

The lava spawner has many visual and functional differences from normal lava:

It is a full, solid cube block with full block collision.
It does not damage entities.
It does not emit light.
All sides use the same still lava texture.

Immediately after placement, the lava spawner creates blocks of lava on each of its four orthogonal sides. If these created blocks are removed, they will be regenerated after enough time.

Unlike with normal lava, lava spawners are deleted by sponges.

Lava Spawner is a removed block and as such issues relating to it cannot be fixed.
