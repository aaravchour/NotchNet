leaves_carried was a block which was used for storing the item model for leaves.

leaves_carried is only known to be obtainable through the use of inventory editors and other external tools.

The speed at which leaves_carried breaks is not currently known. They drop themselves when broken with Shears.

In its base state, leaves_carried highly resembles actual leaves. There are, however, differences: the main difference is that it appears darker than normal leaves, which is due to them using a tint, despite the texture they use already being colored, rather than the grayscale which tinted blocks usually use. Specifically, this tint is the color  #48b518.
However, higher metadata versions of leaves_carried behave unexpectedly. Perhaps most interesting is metadata 1, which corresponds to spruce leaves, which uses a crafting table's side textures rather than anything relevant to leaves. This could be explainable through examination of terrain.png, however, this is yet to be done.
Metadata 1 (corresponding to spruce leaves) is tinted with  #619961, and metadata 2 (corresponding to birch leaves) is tinted with  #80a755. The behaviour of metadata 3, which corresponds to what would eventually become jungle leaves in the same version that removes leaves_carried, is currently unknown.

Despite very closely resembling leaves visually, leaves_carried do not decay.
Other differences, such as whether they drop saplings when broken without shears, or indeed drop anything at all, are unknown.

leaves_carried is a removed block and as such issues relating to it cannot be fixed.
