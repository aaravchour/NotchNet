mod_ore is a block of unknown use. It uses the same textures of the block of gold.

The mod_ore block can only be obtained via commands.

When mined, the mod_ore block doesn't drop anything regardless of the tool that is used.

Its intended usage is unknown, however the name suggests it may be a block of a mod that isn't activated, and got replaced with this, similar to the Unknown Block
