A mushroom block is a solid block that makes up a huge mushroom, which consists of a mushroom stem and brown mushroom blocks or red mushroom blocks, depending on the color of the huge mushroom. The mushroom inside block is the inside/pore of a huge mushroom.

Mushroom blocks are most quickly broken with an axe, dropping 02 mushroom items of the respective type. In Java Edition, only cap blocks drop mushroom items, while in Bedrock Edition stem blocks drop mushrooms as well. Fortune does not affect the drop rate of mushrooms in any form.
The blocks themselves can be retrieved only by using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Mining the mushroom cap or stem yields a block with the cap or stem texture, respectively, on all faces.
Additionally, in Java Edition, if two similar mushroom blocks are placed next to each other and one of them is broken, the side of the other block that it was facing reveals the pore texture. This is because the side of these blocks change texture if they touch another block of the same type.
Mushroom blocks can be moved and are not broken by pistons.

Mushroom blocks generate as part of huge mushroom structures.

In Java Edition, the brown and red mushroom blocks as well as the mushroom stem are available in the Creative inventory.
In Bedrock Edition, all-sided cap blocks, all-sided stem block (with id of "brown_mushroom_block"), and all-sided pore block (with id of "brown_mushroom_block") are available in the Creative inventory.

Mushroom blocks can be used in the composter with an 85% chance to make a new layer.
Mushroom stems can be used in the composter with a 65% / 85% chance to make a new layer.

Mushroom blocks can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sound.

Bedrock Edition:

in Java Edition, there are 3 kinds of mushroom blocks: Red Mushroom Block, Brown Mushroom Block and Mushroom Stem, which have different IDs.
in Bedrock Edition there are only 2 IDs: brown_mushroom_block and red_mushroom_block. Although the stems of the two kinds of huge mushrooms look the same, they have corresponding IDs. But the id of mushroom stem item is always "brown_mushroom_block". Even when mining the red mushroom stem with Silk Touch, the ID of the dropped item is still "brown_mushroom_block". There is another block named "mushroom" in the inventory of creative mode, which is actually a "brown_mushroom_block" with the texture of air holes on all six sides.
