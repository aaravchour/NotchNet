The ominous trial spawner is a stronger variant of the trial spawner. They will appear in the trial chambers if a player with Trial Omen enters the Chambers. This spawner will spawn stronger mobs, but when defeated, it will drop better loot.

Mining an ominous trial spawner with any items will drop nothing, even if mined with Silk Touch, this makes ominous trial spawner unobtainable in Survival without glitches. Ominous trial spawner takes a long time to be mined and will take the same amount of time regardless of the items used to mine.

First, a player with Bad Omen must enter a Trial Chamber. After that, the same player will be given Trial Omen. After this point, all Trial Spawners will become Ominous Trial Spawners. This is only for the time the Trial Omen effect is on a player in the Trial Chamber. Once Ominous Trial Spawners are activated, they will begin spawning harder enemies than normal Trial Spawners; however, when all monsters are defeated, the Ominous Trial Spawner may output an Ominous Trial Key, along with other goodies.
It should be noted that if a player desires to stop this Ominous Event, they may drink a Milk Bucket, or if in multiplayer, the Trial Omen holder may leave the chamber. Alternatively, the player can die to remove the effect.
