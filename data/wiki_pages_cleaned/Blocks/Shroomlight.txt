Shroomlights are light-emitting blocks that generate in huge fungi.

Shroomlight blocks can be broken using any tool, but a hoe is the fastest. They always drop themselves as an item

Both crimson and warped huge fungi can generate shroomlights near their tops. This includes both naturally generated huge fungi and huge fungi grown with bone meal.

Shroomlights provide a light level of 15, the highest level in the game. Unlike Glowstone, Shroomlights also allows redstone signals to pass through them, as they are treated like a solid block. 

Placing a shroomlight into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level.
