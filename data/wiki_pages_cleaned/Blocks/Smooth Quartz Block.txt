A smooth quartz block is a mineral block used only for decoration. It is made by smelting blocks of quartz.

Smooth quartz blocks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

2 smooth quartz blocks generate naturally as part of each bridge bastion remnant.

Smooth quartz blocks can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
