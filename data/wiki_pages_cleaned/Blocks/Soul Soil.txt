Soul soil is a block found abundantly in soul sand valleys. Unlike soul sand it does not slow down players or mobs that walk on it. 

Soul soil drops as an item when broken with any tool or by hand, but a shovel is the fastest way to break it.
A soul campfire, when broken without using a Silk Touch tool, drops a block of soul soil. Since soul campfires can be crafted with renewable soul sand, this makes soul soil renewable as well.

Soul soil generates naturally in the soul sand valley biome.

Unlike soul sand, soul soil does not slow mobs down, does not create bubble columns and does not allow items to fall through into a hopper.

Fire lit on soul soil becomes soul fire.

4 blocks of soul soil (or soul sand) are used in the construction of a wither.

Lava on top of soul soil and directly adjacent to blue ice turns into basalt. Re-producing basalt this way can comprise a "basalt generator."
