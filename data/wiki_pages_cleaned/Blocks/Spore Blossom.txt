A spore blossom is a ceiling-hanging decorative block that emits green particles.

Spore blossoms can be found only on the ceiling of lush caves.

Spore blossoms can be broken instantly using any item or by hand. Harvesting a spore blossom using shears consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.

Spore blossoms can be placed only on the underside of any block except for leaves.
They emit two kinds of particles: one falling straight downwards, disappearing after a certain distance; the other spreading to a large area, floating around in the air, spreading further away as they slowly fall down.
Spore blossoms can be pollinated by bees.

Spore blossoms can be put into a composter with a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
