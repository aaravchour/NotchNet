Torchflower seeds are seeds that have a chance to be dropped by sniffers when they finish digging.

Sniffers will occasionally bury their nose in the ground and start digging. Once the sniffer has finished digging, one torchflower seed will have a chance to be dropped on the floor as an item.
Sniffers can only dig for torchflower seeds in the following blocks:

Dirt
Grass Block
Podzol
Coarse Dirt
Rooted Dirt
Moss Block
Mud
Muddy Mangrove Roots
They cannot dig for torchflower seeds on mycelium, which is intended.

Torchflower seeds can be placed on farmland, where they grow through three stages. Breaking the torchflower crop before it matures drops the seed, while breaking the final stage produces one torchflower and does not yield the seed.
Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.
Farmer villagers can plant torchflower seeds, but cannot harvest them after they have fully grown.

Torchflower seeds can be used to breed sniffers and chickens and reduce the remaining growth duration of snifflets and chicks by 10%. Also, if some torchflower seeds were fed to an injured sniffer, it will heal it by 2 health points.

Both Sniffers and snifflets will follow you when holding a Torchflower seed in your hand.

Torchflower seeds can be used to tame parrots.

Placing torchflower seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

The final growth stage of the torchflower crop uses the same ID as the actual torchflower. This causes some side effects, such as the plant becoming offset and randomly jumping to the side.
