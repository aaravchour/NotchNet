Tuff bricks are the brick version of polished tuff or tuff.

Tuff bricks block drops as an item if mined by any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

Tuff bricks generate naturally in trial chambers.

When trial chambers were showcased in the Minecraft Live 2023, the tuff bricks textures were flipped upside down, making them stand out from the other brick variant blocks.
The textures were later reflipped back in the next snapshot, after a bug report was issued.
Tuff bricks fit the perfect color gradient between deepslate bricks and stone bricks, since it is a slightly greenish gray.
