Unknown is a placeholder block exclusive to Bedrock Edition that generates in place where blocks have an invalid ID or invalid components in their behavior files. 

The block cannot be obtained, even when using commands.
Loading a block with an incorrect ID will result in it being replaced by an unknown block, although it retains its ID.
Some Marketplace worlds that are meant for older versions of the game can generate this block. These may include worlds that haven't updated to work with the latest version.

Unknown blocks break instantly and have lower friction. Unknown blocks are able to be broken and picked up, but are unable to be placed.
