Wood or hyphae is a block that has the log's "bark" texture on all six sides. It comes in eleven types: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, mangrove, cherry, pale oak, crimson, and warped. 
Stripped wood or stripped hyphae is a variant obtained when any axe is used on wood or hyphae respectively.
Wood also have many uses, ranged from building to crafting some other construction materials and items. 

Wood and hyphae can be broken by hand, but using an axe is the fastest.

Oak wood and stripped oak wood generate in plains villages.
Acacia wood generates in savanna villages.
Spruce wood and stripped spruce wood generate in snowy plains, snowy taiga, and taiga villages.

Wood or hyphae can be crafted out of four matching logs or stems, yielding three wood or hyphae as a result. Same goes for stripped wood. 

Using an axe on wood or hyphae turns it into stripped wood or hyphae, which act the same as regular wood or hyphae.

Wood and hyphae can be placed in three orientations, similarly to normal logs.

Wood and stripped wood can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.
Hyphae and stripped hyphae cannot be used as a fuel in furnaces.
