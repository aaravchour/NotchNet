The Larger Icy Golem is a boss variant of the Icy Golem that can be fought optionally in "Giant Consequences".

The Larger Icy Golem, like its smaller counterparts are capable of throwing snowballs capable of knocking the player back but instead of a few, it can fire multiple and can rotate its arms firing a barrage. When its legs are broken, it swings an arm throwing a row of snowballs and can clap a shockwave of snowballs.

The Larger Icy Golem is a bulky and larger variant of the smaller Icy Golems, possessing a bulkier body and thicker legs. It also lacks the grey cracks and instead has small black buttons on its chest like normal snow golems. Like its smaller counterparts, it wears a pumpkin and its real face and head is small and has a dazed look in the same style as the original snow golem's face.

In "Giant Consequences", if Jesse goes with Radar and Lukas, he'll have to fight the boss Icy Golem until it is defeated by having all its limbs destroyed.

Killed By:

Jesse (Determinant)
Lukas (Off-Screen, Determinant)
If Jesse goes with Lukas and Radar, Jesse kills the Icy Golem by taking off its legs to get to its head. Jesse pulls it off its pumpkin mask, killing it.

As mentioned by Eric Stirpe, whatever mob in Romeo's Icy Palace of Despair was called "icy [mob name here]."
