An egg is an item that can be used to craft food items, or thrown for a chance to spawn chicks on impact.

A chicken drops an egg item every 510 minutes. The theoretical average would be expected at 1 egg every 7.5 minutes, or 0.1333 eggs per minute.
A fox sometimes spawns holding an egg, which it always drops upon death. Alternatively, a player dropping a food item causes the fox to drop the egg.

Players are able to throw eggs and deal knockback to mobs (but not other players), but no damage is dealt, similar to a snowball. Likewise, throwing eggs at neutral mobs provokes them. Eggs can also be fired from dispensers and are affected by gravity.

When thrown by a dispenser or by pressing the use button, an egg has a 18 (12.5%) chance of spawning a chick. If this occurs, there is a 132 (3.125%) chance of spawning three additional chicks (on average, 1 out of every 256 eggs spawns 4 chicks). In other words, whenever an egg is thrown, there is a 31256 chance of spawning 1 chick and a 1256 chance of spawning four chicks.
The expected value of the number of chicks an egg produces is 35256 or 13.7%. This means that on average, a chick is spawned every 7.3 eggs, a stack of 16 eggs spawns 2.188 chicks, and a full inventory including the hotbar and off-hand (37 * 16 = 592 eggs) is expected to spawn approximately 81 chicks.

Issues relating to "Egg" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

Eggs break mid-fall if hit by another projectile; the chance of spawning a chick is not affected.
Throwing an egg at a nether portal breaks the egg when it hits the portal.
A thrown egg faces toward the player in first-person view, while it appears rotated horizontally in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable items (ender pearls, eggs, snowballs, and all throwable potions).
