A pickaxe is a tool required to mine ores, rocks, rock-based blocks and metal-based blocks quickly and obtain them as items. A pickaxe mines faster and can obtain more block types as items depending on the material it is made from.

Pickaxes are crafted using 2 sticks and 3 identical units of tool material.

Pickaxes can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tier's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down.

In Bedrock Edition, novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell stone pickaxes for one emerald, Journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell enchanted iron pickaxes for 3 emeralds, and master-level toolsmith villagers always sell enchanted diamond pickaxes for 13 emeralds.
In Java Edition, novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell a stone pickaxe for one emerald, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron pickaxe for 722 emeralds, and a master-level toolsmith always sells an enchanted diamond pickaxe for 1835 emeralds.
The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 519.

In Java Edition, toolsmith villagers throw stone pickaxes at players under the Hero of the Village effect.

In Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators have a chance of dropping a damaged iron pickaxe when killed during a raid. The pickaxe has a 50% chance of being enchanted with random enchantment(s).

A pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that break instantly. Pickaxes have different amounts of uses based on the type:

Wooden: 60
Stone: 132
Copper: 191
Iron: 251
Golden: 33
Diamond: 1,562
Netherite: 2,032
Different qualities of pickaxe are required to successfully harvest certain ores and blocks. For example, while stone can be mined with any pickaxe, gold ore must be mined with an iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe, or else the player harvests no ore. Different pickaxes also mine many materials at different speeds:
