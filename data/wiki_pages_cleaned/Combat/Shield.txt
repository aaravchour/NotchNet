A shield is a tool used for protecting the player against attacks.

Shields may also be repaired on an anvil by using planks or another shield. Shields repaired on anvils retain their pattern.

Journeyman-level armorer villagers have 13/25 chance of selling a shield for 5 emeralds as their sixth trade.

Despite using iron in its crafting recipe, it cannot be smelted into iron nuggets.

Shields are used for blocking incoming attacks. Using or sneaking causes a player to slow to a sneaking pace, and after 5 game ticks (0.25 seconds), attacks coming from in front of the player are blocked, dealing no damage. When the shield blocks an attack of 3 or stronger, it takes durability damage equal to the strength of the attack rounded up.  
Most blocked projectiles that carry status effects (such as shulker bullets, flaming arrows, or tipped arrows) do not affect the blocker. Tridents & arrows can be deflected into other targets. Knockback from melee attacks and projectiles is prevented, while knockback from explosions, hoglin, and ravager attacks are significantly reduced.
The shield directionally blocks all attacks coming from within the FOV of the direction the wielder is facing, providing a full hemisphere of coverage to them. If the wielder faces straight up, they are likely to miss their blocks.
Mobs that deal continuous contact damage such as the slime, magma cube, and blaze rapidly drain the shield's durability for as long as the shielded player remains within the mob's hitbox.
Blockable attacks include:

Melee attacks, except by a warden, axe-wielding mobs or by a sprinting player wielding an axe, however even without sprinting an axe still greatly decreases the durability
Status effects do not carry through to the blocker.
Normal, tipped, and spectral arrows
Arrows other than Piercing are totally deflected and can hit other targets.
Status effects do not carry through to the blocker.
This can be used to damage the attacker or another mob down there.
Flaming arrows
Burning does not carry through to the blocker.
Tridents
Snowballs and eggs
Spines from pufferfish
Bullets from shulkers
The levitation effect does not carry through to the blocker.
Spit from llamas
Fireballs, such as from blazes and fire charges
Burning does not carry through to the blocker.
Direct hits from ghast fireballs
These still cause environmental damage.
All explosions
Explosion damage from creepers
TNT that another player lit
Ravager headbutts
These still knock the blocker back by about 3 blocks.
Blocking these strikes can stun the ravager for a moment, and it roars afterward.
Ravager roars are blocked but still knock back the blocker.
Bee stings are blocked, but bees continuously attack until the player stops blocking and the player is stung.
Beam attacks from guardians or elder guardians (only reduces damage by 50%).
Damage reflected from Thorns enchantment / guardians.
They cannot block:

Arrows from a crossbow enchanted with Piercing
This does not reduce the shield's durability.
Status effects from tipped arrows or shulker bullets  
Direct projectile damage is blocked, but the effect still carries through.
Status effects from splash/lingering potions, evokers' fangs, or breath from the ender dragon
Beam attacks from guardians or elder guardians, or the warden's sonic boom attack
TNT that the blocking player lit themselves
TNT that a redstone mechanism lit
Fall damage, including that from ender pearls
This also includes when the player rides an entity that died due to fall damage.
Strikes from a warden or any axe-wielding mob (e.g., vindicators, piglin brutes, zombies after disabling players shield they attack another time immediately)
Such strikes disable being able to use shields for 5 seconds.

Shields can be decorated by applying a banner.

Unlike with banners, shields cannot be repainted or washed in a cauldron. Shields have only half the resolution of banners, making patterns look slightly different. In the game files, the pattern textures can be found in a separate directory called entity/shield.
In Java Edition, shields with patterns can also be obtained using the same commands as banners, except banner has to be replaced with shield.

A shield can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil:
