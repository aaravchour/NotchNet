Splash potions are a variant of potions that can be thrown.

Splash potions are brewed by adding gunpowder to a normal potion, including uncraftable potions of luck and decay.

One splash potion of weakness can be found in a brewing stand inside an igloo basement.

Using a glass bottle on a cauldron that contains splash potion turns it into a bottle of that splash potion, this also removes 13 of the cauldron's content.

Piglins have a 1.74% chance of bartering a splash potion of Fire Resistance when given a gold ingot.
 

Lingering potions are brewed by adding dragon's breath to a splash potion.

Splash potions are thrown by using them. On impact they explode, applying status effects to nearby entities. When thrown by the player, they have a range of 8 blocks if thrown at the best angle. The bottle is lost, unlike drinkable potions. Entities within an 8.258.254.25 cuboid centered on the thrown potion at impact and within 4 blocks euclidean distance of the thrown potion at impact are affected.
In Bedrock Edition, splash potions' effects have only three-fourths of the duration of the drinkable form. In Java Edition, splash and drinkable forms have the same duration.
If the potion directly collides with an entity, the entity gets the full duration and potency of the effect. Otherwise, the farther away the entity is from the center of the impact, the lesser the imbued effect. For instant effects (i.e. Healing or Harming), the potency of the effect reduces linearly from 100% on a direct hit to 0% at 4 blocks' distance. For other effects, the potency is unchanged, but the duration decreases linearly on the same scale (rounded to the nearest 120 second), with no effect being applied if the duration would be 1 second or less.

Splash water bottles have no effect on almost all entities, but they extinguish fire in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it.
A splash water bottle deals 1 damage to endermen, striders, snow golems, and blazes; however, endermen have a chance of teleporting away if hit with one.
Splash water bottles can extinguish a burning entity.

Splash water bottles can be used on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt to turn it into mud.

In Bedrock Edition, using a splash potion on a cauldron adds one level of that potion to the cauldron. Attempting to add a splash potion to a cauldron with water, dyed water or a non-matching potion empties the cauldron and creates an explosion sound (but no actual explosion).

In Java Edition, the uncraftable potion is a splash potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay. It is also available in potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.
It can be obtained in two distinct (though functionally identical) variants, using the following commands: /give @s minecraft:splash_potion{Potion:"minecraft:empty"} or /give @s minecraft:splash_potion. It is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.

In Java Edition, splash potions can be obtained with any status effect using /give and the tag CustomPotionEffects, which is an array of effects for the potion. See Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.

Splash potions when thrown have entity data that define various properties of the entity.

If an enderman is targeted directly by a splash potion, it teleports away before the potion can affect it. However, if an enderman is caught in the splash radius of a potion not aimed at it, it takes damage from the potion.
If killed by a splash potion of harming, the death message would be: <player> was killed by <attacker> using magic
A thrown splash potion faces toward the player in first-person view, while it appears rotated horizontally in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable items (ender pearls, eggs, snowballs, and all throwable potions).

Bedrock Edition has unused splash potion textures for several effects, along with their normal variants. These effects are: Absorption, Blindness, Haste, Health Boost, Hunger, Mining Fatigue, Nausea, Resistance, Saturation, and Levitation, as well as the Luck potion textures also present in Java Edition. These unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha, except for the potion of levitation, which was added in Pocket Edition 1.0.0. The textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the texture update in Bedrock Edition 1.10.0. Strangely, the potion of levitation texture is a duplicate of the splash potion of levitation texture.
