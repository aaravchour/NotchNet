Lets the player's agent right-click on the block in the specified direction.

place <slotNum: int> <direction: string>

slotNum: int

Specifies the slot number of block to be placed, slots are numbered from 1 to 27.
direction: string

Specifies the direction of Agent to place the block.
Must be one of:
forward to place the block on the front.
back to place the block on the back.
left to place the block on the left-hand side.
right to place the block on the right-hand side.
up to place the block on the top-hand side.
down to place the block on the bottom-hand side.

Fails if the arguments are not specified correctly or the specified slot was empty.
On success, returns if a block in the specified inventory slot was placed.

This basically places a block (ex: Place Stone Block) or a placeable item (ex: Place Oak Fence) from the selected inventory slot in the specified direction. 
However, this doesnt interact with things like doors, levers, and containers.
Additionally, when player specifies a slot which contains the following non-place-able items, this behaves as follows:

Place water/lava
Bucket
Till grass
Hoe
Make a path
Shovel
Spawn a mob
Spawn Eggs
Dye something
Dyes
Make a fire
Flint and Steel
Fire Charge
Placeable material
Boat
Minecart
Bottle
