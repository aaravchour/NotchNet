Changes a block to another block.

Java Edition
setblock <pos> <block> [destroy|keep|replace]
Bedrock Edition
setblock <position: x y z> <tileName: Block> <blockStates: block states> [destroy|keep|replace]
setblock <position: x y z> <tileName: Block> [destroy|keep|replace]

JE: <pos>: block_posBE: position: x y z: CommandPosition

Specifies the position of the block to be changed.
In Java Edition, must be a block position composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be an integer or a tilde and caret notation. In Bedrock Edition, must be a three-dimensional coordinates composed of <x>, <y> and <z>, each of which must be a floating-point number or tilde and caret notation.
JE: <block>: block_stateBE: tileName: Block: enum

Specifies the new block.
In Java Edition, must be in the format of block_id[block_states]{data_tags}(does not accept block tags), in which block states and data tags can be omitted when they are not needed. In Bedrock Edition, must be a block id.
BE: blockStates: block states: BlockStateCommandParam

Specifies the block states to use for the block.
Must be a blockstate argument as ["<state1>":<value1>,"<state2>":<value2>,...]. For example: ["old_leaf_type":"birch","persistent_bit":true].
destroy|keep|replace

Specifies how to handle the block change. Must be one of:
destroy  The old block drops both itself and its contents (as if destroyed by a player). Plays the appropriate block breaking noise.
keep  Only air blocks are changed (non-air blocks are unchanged).
replace  The old block drops neither itself nor any contents. Plays no sound.
If not specified, defaults to replace.

Put a chest facing east at your feet
setblock ~ ~ ~ chest[facing=east]
setblock ~ ~ ~ chest ["facing_direction"=5]
Place a sign next to it in Java Edition
setblock ~ ~ ~-1 birch_sign{Text1:'"My chest"',Text2:'"Do not open!"'} (Note the two sets of quotes around the text. They are required.)
Put a top quartz slab at the top of your head
setblock ~ ~2 ~ quartz_slab[type=top]
setblock ~ ~2 ~ stone_slab ["stone_slab_type"="quartz","top_slot_bit"=true]
