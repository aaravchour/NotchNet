Teleports entities to random surface locations within an area.

Targets are always placed on the top non-air block (whether it's solid or not) at a horizontal location (if not in under mode), and never on lava, water, bubble column, or fire.
In Java Edition, the entities are spread to the command's execution dimension.
In Bedrock Edition, the command changes an entity's position without changing dimension. But the position is calculated in the command's execution dimension.
The /spreadplayers command does not have a uniform distribution over the surface. It has a Gaussian distribution as the positions closer to the position set in the command have a higher chance of having an entity on them. This effect is very subtle and is not visible for short radius but can be a problem if you want a uniform random generation. This problem does not occur for the @r selector and dispensers.

Java Edition
spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> <respectTeams> <targets>
spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> under <maxHeight> <respectTeams> <targets>
Spreads players to resulting position under the maximum height.
Bedrock Edition
spreadplayers <x: value> <z: value> <spreadDistance: float> <maxRange: float> <victim: target>

JE: <center>: vec2
BE: x: value: RelativeFloat and z: value: RelativeFloat

Specifies the center of the region to spread targets to.
Must be a two-dimensional coordinates with floating-point number elements. Accepts tilde and caret notations.
JE: <spreadDistance>: floatBE: spreadDistance: float: float

Specifies the minimum distance between targets.
Must be a  Single-precision floating-point format number. In Java Edition, it must be greater than or equal to 0.0. In Bedrock Edition, it should be at least 0.0.
JE: <maxRange>: floatBE: maxRange: float: float

Specifies the maximum distance on each horizontal axis from the center of the area to spread targets (thus, the area is square, not circular).
Must be a  Single-precision floating-point format number. In Java Edition, it must be greater than or equal to 1.0. In Bedrock Edition, it must be at least 1.0 greater than spreadDistance: float.
JE: <maxHeight>: integer

Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions.
Must be a  Single-precision floating-point format number. And it must be greater than or equal to 1.0.
JE: <respectTeams>: bool

Specifies whether to keep teams together. If true, targets on the same team are teleported to the same location.
Must be a  boolean (either true or false).
JE: <targets>: entityBE: victim: target: CommandSelector<Actor>

Specifies the targets to spread.
Must be a player name, a target selector or a UUID. 

To teleport all players by team to random surface locations in a 1,0001,000-block area centered on (0,0), with a minimum distance between teams of 200 blocks:
spreadplayers 0 0 200 500 true @a
To teleport one random player from each of three teams (Red, Blue, and Green), as well as Alice and Bob, to random surface locations in a 200200-block area centered on (0,0), with a minimum distance between players of 50 blocks:
spreadplayers 0 0 50 100 false @r[team=Red] @r[team=Blue] @r[team=Green] Alice Bob

/tp and /teleport  different commands that teleport a single player or entity to a specific position (even underground).
