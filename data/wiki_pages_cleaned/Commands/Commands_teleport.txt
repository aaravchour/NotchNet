Teleports entities (players, mobs, etc.).
Although most commands can affect only chunks that have already been generated, /teleport can send entities into chunks that have yet to be generated. If this happens to a player, then the chunks around and including that player's destination are newly generated.

Java Edition
teleport <destination>
teleport <targets> <destination>
Teleports the executor or the specified entity(s) to the position of an entity, and makes its rotation the same as the specified entity's.
teleport <location>
Teleports the executor to a certain position (and changes its rotation to the command's execution rotation).
teleport <targets> <location>
Teleports the entity(s) to a certain position (without changing their rotation).
teleport <targets> <location> <rotation>
teleport <targets> <location> facing <facingLocation>
teleport <targets> <location> facing entity <facingEntity> [<facingAnchor>]
Teleports the entity(s) to a certain position and changes their rotation to the specified rotation.
Bedrock Edition
teleport <destination: target> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
teleport <victim: target> <destination: target> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
Teleports the executor or the specified entity(s) to the position of an entity, and makes it face horizontally and its horizontal rotation the same as the specified entity's.
teleport <destination: x y z> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
teleport <victim: target> <destination: x y z> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
Teleports the executor or the specified entity(s) to a certain position (without changing its rotation).
teleport <destination: x y z> [yRot: value] [xRot: value] [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
teleport <destination: x y z> facing <lookAtPosition: x y z> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
teleport <destination: x y z> facing <lookAtEntity: target> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
teleport <victim: target> <destination: x y z> [yRot: value] [xRot: value] [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
teleport <victim: target> <destination: x y z> facing <lookAtPosition: x y z> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
teleport <victim: target> <destination: x y z> facing <lookAtEntity: target> [checkForBlocks: Boolean]
Teleports the executor or the specified entity(s) to a certain position and changes their rotation to the specified rotation.

JE: <targets>: entityBE: victim: target: CommandSelector<Actor>

Specifies the entity(s) to be teleported. If not specified, defaults to the command's executor.
Must be a player name, a target selector or a UUID. 
JE: <location>: vec3BE: destination: x y z: CommandPositionFloat

Specifies the coordinates to teleport the target(s) to.
Must be a three-dimensional coordinates with floating-point number elements. Accepts tilde and caret notations.
JE: <destination>: entityBE: destination: target: CommandSelector<Actor>

Specifies the entity to teleport the target(s) to.
Must be a player name, a target selector or a UUID.  In Java Edition, the target selector must be in single type.
JE: <rotation>: rotation
BE: yRot: value: RelativeFloat and <xRot: value>: RelativeFloat

Specifies the rotation.
Must be a rotation with double or float number elements, including yaw and pitch, measured in degrees.For the horizontal rotation (yaw), -180.0 for due north, -90.0 for due east, 0.0 for due south, 90.0 for due west, to 179.9 for just west of due north, before wrapping back around to -180.0.For the vertical rotation (pitch), -90.0 for straight up to 90.0 for straight down.Tilde notation can be used to specify a rotation relative to the execution rotation.
JE: <facingLocation>: vec3BE: lookAtPosition: x y z: CommandPositionFloat

Specifies the coordinates to make the target(s) facing to.
JE: <facingEntity>: entityBE: lookAtEntity: target: CommandSelector<Actor>

Specifies the entity to make the target(s) facing to.
Must be a player name, a target selector or a UUID. 
JE: <facingAnchor>: entity_anchor

Specifies whether the entity'eyes or feet to make the target(s) facing to. If not specified, defaults to feet. In Java Edition, the anchor of the targets can be changed with /execute anchored. In Bedrock Edition, always facing the entity's feet from the targets' feet.
Must be either eyes or feet.
BE: checkForBlocks: Boolean: enum

Must be a  boolean (either true or false).
If set to true, teleports the target(s) only if the target(s) would not collide with a block it cannot be inside (Note: this allows teleporting into flowers as well as midair). If false or not specified, the default behavior applies (do no check; just teleport the target(s)).

To teleport the executing player to Alice: teleport Alice
To teleport all players to the executing player: teleport @a @s
To teleport the executing player to x=100 and z=100, but three blocks above their current position: teleport 100 ~3 100
To rotate the nearest player 10 degrees to the right without changing their position:  execute as @p at @s run teleport @s ~ ~ ~ ~10 ~
When used via the execute command, can teleport between the Overworld, the Nether and the End:
To teleport the executing player to the same coordinates, but in the Nether:
execute in minecraft:the_nether run teleport ~ ~ ~
execute in nether run teleport ~ ~ ~
To teleport all players to x=84 y=57 z=79 in the End:
execute as @a in minecraft:the_end run teleport 84 57 79
execute as @a in the_end run teleport 84 57 79
To teleport Alice to x=251 y=64 z=-160 in the Overworld:
execute as Alice in minecraft:overworld run teleport 251 64 -160
execute as Alice in overworld run teleport 251 64 -160
