Changes or queries the world's game time.

Java Edition
time add <time>
Adds <time> to the in-game daytime.
time query (daytime|gametime|day)
Queries current time.
time set (day|night|noon|midnight)
time set <time>
Sets the internal daytime.
Bedrock Edition
time add <amount: int>
Adds <time> to the internal daytime.
time query <daytime|gametime|day>
Queries current time.
time set <amount: int>
time set <time: TimeSpec>
Sets the internal daytime.

JE: <time>: timeBE: amount: int: int

Specifies the time to add or set.
In Java Edition, it must be a single-precision floating point number suffixed with a unit. Units include:d: an in-game day, 24000 gameticks;s: a second, 20 gameticks;t (default and omitable): a single gametick; the default unit.The time is set to the closest integer tick after unit conversion. For example. .5d is same as 12000 ticks.In Bedrock Edition it must be a  32-bit integer number.
daytime|gametime|day

Specifies the time to query. Must be daytime, gametime or day.
daytime - the number of game ticks since dawn. (the internal daytime modulo 24000)
gametime - the age of the world in game ticks. (the game time modulo 2147483647)
day - the number of in-game days passed. (the internal daytime divided by 24000, then modulo 2147483647)
JE: day|night|noon|midnight
BE: time: TimeSpec: enum

Specifies the time to set.
Must be day, night, noon, midnight, sunrise, or sunset.
day = 1,000
night = 13,000
noon = 6,000
midnight = 18,000
sunrise = 23,000
sunset = 12,000

/time set ... command in Java Edition always directly sets the "internal daytime" to the specified number. But in Bedrock Edition, when time: TimeSpec is specified, it increases the "internal daytime" to meet the specified time: TimeSpec.
For example:

in Java Edition, when executing /time set day or /time set 1000, the "internal daytime" is set to 1000, so the "day" value returns to 0.
In Bedrock Edition, when executing /time set 1000, the "internal daytime" is also set to 1000. But if now the "internal daytime" is 25001 (1 day + 1001 ticks), after executing /time set day, it won't become 1000 or 25000, since it only increases time when using time: TimeSpec. In fact, it turns into 49000 (2 days + 1000 ticks), and the "day" value becomes 2. If now the "internal daytime" is 25000 (1 day + 1000 ticks), after executing /time set day, it remains unchanged.

To set the time to 1,000: time set 1000
To add one day to the world time: time add 24000
To change/reset in-game day count to desired number: time set <desired day number*24000+time of day in ticks>; to change day count to day 472 at noon (6000): time set 11334000
