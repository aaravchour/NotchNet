Teleports entities (players, mobs, items, etc.).
The primary difference between this command and the /teleport command is that /tp uses coordinates relative to the teleported targets, while /teleport uses coordinates relative to the command's execution.
Although most commands can only affect chunks that have already been generated, /tp can send entities into chunks that have yet to be generated. If this happens to a player, then the chunks around and including that player's destination will be newly generated.

tp <destination player>
tp <x> <y> <z> [<yaw> <pitch>]
tp <target player> <destination player>
tp <target player> <x> <y> <z> [<yaw> <pitch>]

<target player>

Specifies the entity(s) to be teleported. Must be a player name, a target selector, or a UUID.
Permits entities other than players.
<x> <y> <z> (BE: destination: x y z)

Specifies the coordinates to teleport the target(s) to. <x> and <z> must fall within the range -30,000,000 to 30,000,000 (exclusive, without the commas), and <y> must be within the range -4096 to 4096, inclusive. May use tilde and caret notation to specify a position relative to the target's current position  an exception to tilde notation's usual rule of being relative to the executor of the command. /teleport can be used to teleport relative to executor of the command.
<destination player>

Specifies the entity to teleport the target(s) to. Must be a player name, a target selector, or a UUID.
Permits entity other than players.
<yaw> and <pitch>

Specifies the rotation.
For the horizontal rotation (yaw), -180.0 for due north, -90.0 for due east, 0.0 for due south, 90.0 for due west, to 179.9 for just west of due north, before wrapping back around to -180.0.
For the vertical rotation (pitch), -90.0 for straight up to 90.0 for straight down.
Tilde notation can be used to specify a rotation relative to the target's previous rotation.

Fails if the arguments are not specified correctly, if <target player> fails to resolve to one or more entities (named players must be online), or if <destination player> fails to resolve to a single entity (a named player must be online). Fails individually for each entity referenced by <target player> that is not in the same dimension as the <destination player>, if specified.
On success, teleports the targets to the specified destination.

To teleport yourself to Alice: tp Alice
To teleport all players to yourself: tp @a @s
To teleport yourself to x=100 and z=100, but three blocks above your current position: tp 100 ~3 100
To rotate the nearest player 10 degrees to the right without changing their position: tp @p ~ ~ ~ ~10 ~
