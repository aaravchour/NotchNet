The alias /connect can also be used.

wsserver <serverUri: text>
connect <serverUri: text>
Connect or disconnect to specified WebSocket server.

serverUri: text: CommandRawText

A URI indicating a WebSocket server. Or any string to disconnect from current WebSocket server.
It is a greedy phrase string argument (taking the rest of the command as the string argument).

Fails if the argument is not specified correctly.

Primarily used with Education Edition's Code Connection and Classroom Mode. MCWSS is an outdated API worked on by the community that was meant to let people easily write WebSocket programs for Minecraft. MCWSS
