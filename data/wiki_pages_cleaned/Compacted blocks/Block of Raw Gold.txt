A block of raw gold is a raw metal block equivalent to nine raw gold.

Blocks of raw gold only drop themselves as items when mined using an iron pickaxe or better.

Blocks of raw gold are a compact way to store raw gold.

Piglins become distracted upon a player dropping a block of raw gold as an item, and become enraged if a player breaks a block of raw gold near them.
