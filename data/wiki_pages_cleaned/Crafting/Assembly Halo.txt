The Assembly Halo is a portable crafting tool added by Botania. 
When held, a ring divided into 12 segments will appear around the player. Right clicking on the Crafting Table segment will open the crafting interface. The other 11 segments can hold one recipe each. 
Right clicking on an empty one will set it to the last recipe made in the crafting segment. 
Right clicking a slot with a recipe will craft the item once using items from the player's inventory. Shift-left clicking will remove the recipe.
