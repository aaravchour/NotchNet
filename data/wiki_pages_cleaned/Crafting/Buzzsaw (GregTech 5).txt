This page is about the Buzzsaw added by GregTech 5. For other uses, see Buzzsaw.

The Buzzsaw is a tool added by GregTech 5 for crafting recipes that require a Saw. It is more power efficient than the Chainsaw, but cannot be used to harvest blocks.

The Buzzsaw is made from Stainless Steel components, a battery, a motor, and a Buzzsaw Blade.

The battery may be filled with either Sodium, Cadmium, or Lithium, and must be a Small Battery. The battery may be charged or empty. If it is charged, the resulting tool will be created with the same charge contained in the battery.

The Buzzsaw Blade is crafted with four of the same plates of any tool material. 

The Buzzsaw Blade defines the tool's durability. For a list of tool materials, see Material Properties.

The Buzzsaw can be used in place of a Saw in any crafting recipe that requires one. Crafting with a Buzzsaw consumes EU with a 4% chance of also consuming durability. Using a Buzzsaw in a crafting recipe consumes much less EU than a Chainsaw and is the ideal tool for the task. The Buzzsaw still has a limited lifetime, and will break and disappear when its durability runs out.
A Buzzsaw with any amount of durability can be placed in a Disassembler to recover some or all of its components.
