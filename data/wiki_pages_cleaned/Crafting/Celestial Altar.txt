The Celestial Altar is a block added by Astral Sorcery. It is the third tier of crafting altar and is used throughout the Constellation chapter of the Astral Tome.
The Altar works similarly to its predecessor the Starlight Crafting Altar, and can make all recipes that the latter can. However, it has 8 extra input slots that can be used for more crafting recipes, can gather Starlight much more efficiently, and requires a larger structure to be built in order to support it.

The complete structure is 11x5x11 and requires (on top of the Altar):

4  Runed Marble
40  Marble Bricks
49  Sooty Marble
12  Marble
8  Marble Pillars
4  Chiseled Marble

This will directly change the Starlight Crafting Altar instead of dropping the output in the world.
