This page is about the Cyclic Assembler added by Thermal Expansion 3. For other uses, see Cyclic Assembler.

The Cyclic Assembler is a machine added by Thermal Expansion 3. It uses formatted Schematics to produce the pattern until it runs out of power or materials placed in its storage. It uses 2 Minecraft Joules (MJ) per item crafted. If a recipe uses a container of liquid, the player can pipe the liquid into the internal tank instead of supplying the containers.

The blue tab in the GUI is used to program the Schematic. Place a blank schematic in the schematic slot in the machine, then create the pattern in the tab and press the check mark to encode the pattern on the schematic.
