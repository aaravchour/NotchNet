The LiquiCrafter is the automatic crafting table from MineFactory Reloaded akin to Buildcraft's Auto Workbench except it can hold 9 different liquids in an internal buffer for crafting things that require liquids (ex: Coolant Cells). Each liquid inventory can hold 10 buckets of liquid.

To use the LiquiCrafter effectively, it is preferred to use it for items that require liquids to craft such as Coolant Cells or Ender-Thermic Pumps.
To craft, the player must set ghost images of the items in the crafting grid and put the materials in the inventory below. A Redstone pulse will make one of the item, allowing it to be removed.
Liquids must be pumped into the LiquiCrafter. Right-clicking with a Bucket or a Can/Empty Cell will not work.
