The Starlight Crafting Altar is a block added by Astral Sorcery. It is the second tier of crafting altar and is used throughout the Attunement chapter of the Astral Tome.
The Altar works similarly to its predecessor the Luminous Crafting Table, and can make all recipes that the latter can. However, it has 4 extra input slots that can be used for more crafting recipes, and gather Starlight much more efficiently, but requires a complete structure to be built around it in order to do so.

The complete structure is 9x4x9 and requires (in addition to the Altar):

8  Chiseled Marble
28  Marble Arches
24  Marble Bricks
21  Sooty Marble
8  Marble Pillars

This will directly change the Luminous Crafting Table instead of dropping the output in the world.
