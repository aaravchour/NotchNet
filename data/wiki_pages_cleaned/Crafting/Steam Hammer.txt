The Steam Hammer is a block from Flaxbeard's Steam Power. It is used to perform anvil actions with steam, rather than experience levels. Steam must be piped into the back face of the block. 
The Steam Hammer must be placed directly above an Anvil to work. The GUI is identical in design and functionality to the Anvil GUI. When it is repairing or renaming a tool, it will be animated, displaying a forging-like motion on the anvil. Additionally, it will show the tool on top of the Anvil.
Pipes can only be placed on the backside of the block, and Steam Gauges cannot be placed on any side.
