The Voline is a hostile mob added by Infernal Expansion. It is unique because of its crafting mechanic. If the player holds Magma Cream, the Voline will stop attacking.
When attacking, it prioritizes entities with Fire Resistance, and then it attacks players.

If the Voline is fed four Magma Cream and then one of the input items listed below, it will convert it into the output listed below.
