Underwater TNT is a block that can be used by the player to initiate a controlled explosion underwater.

Underwater TNT can be broken instantly using any tool, or without a tool. However, primed underwater TNT cannot be broken, as it is an entity.

Underwater TNT blocks can be activated the same way as a normal TNT block.

Once activated, it explodes like a normal TNT block. However, unlike the TNT block, it can destroy blocks underwater. It can still explode in the air, although it does not work in lava. Underwater TNT has the same delayed detonation rate as normal TNT.

The inclusion of sodium is a reference to elemental sodium's explosive reaction with water. All alkaline metals react with water violently to form hydrogen gas and a hydroxide. The heat generated often ignites the gas.
