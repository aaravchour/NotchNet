Balloons are entities that float upward when placed.

Balloons are available in the Creative inventory or commands in Education Edition only.

When used on a mob, a fence, or a wall, balloons attach to the mob or block, similarly to a lead. Balloons float into the air faster than the speed the player flies up, but remain grounded if tied to a fence. If tied to a mob, the balloon floats away and carries the mob into the air, before both eventually despawn or disappear.
