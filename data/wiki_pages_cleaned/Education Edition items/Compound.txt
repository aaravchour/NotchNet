Compounds are a type of item from Education Edition used in chemistry, which are created from combinations of various elements.

Compounds cannot be obtained in the Creative inventory. They are only obtained from creating them in the compound creator. This is done by inserting a certain number of elements corresponding to the compound's chemical formula.

Natural compounds are compounds which can be obtained naturally in Minecraft.

Garbage is considered a "compound", but the only way to produce it is to activate the Lab Table when its inputs are an invalid recipe. It has no uses.

Certain compounds are used as ingredients in crafting or lab table experiments. Natural compounds have uses outside of chemistry, detailed in their respective articles.

Sounds are produced when a lab table creates garbage.

Compounds uses the following data values:

In the chemistry resource pack folder, there are numerous compound textures which are not used in the game. Note: a compound item with a data value of 38 will have the Blue Flask texture and will be called item.compound..name. If you use an NBT Editor to get a compound item with no assigned data value (by deleting the data tag) and then transfer that item to another world / realm using structure blocks (by exporting to a .mcstructure file, then importing it on another world or realm) then it will be renamed to Ivory Tusk.
