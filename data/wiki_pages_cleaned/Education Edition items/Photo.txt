A photo is an item containing a picture taken with a camera.

A photo in a portfolio can be saved as a photo item by selecting the "Save to Inventory" button underneath it.

Photos display an image when held in the hand or when placed in an item frame, similarly to maps. Photos can have captions added to them by renaming them in an anvil or by adding a caption while they are in a portfolio. Photos can be added to book and quills and portfolios by selecting the "Add Photo" button in the book and quill or portfolio.
