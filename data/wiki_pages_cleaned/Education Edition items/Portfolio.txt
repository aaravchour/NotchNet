A portfolio is an item that can save photos taken with a camera.

Portfolios can be obtained in the creative inventory or through the /give command.

Once a photo has been taken using the camera, it appears in the portfolio. Once equipped, right-clicking brings up a two-page book of photos the player has taken, in chronological order. Captions can be added below each picture. Pressing the "Export Portfolio" button creates a .zip file with all photos as JPGs in a specified folder. The portfolio is also used to load custom items in Minecraft China.
