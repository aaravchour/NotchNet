A sparkler is a chemistry-related item that emits particles when lit.
Sparklers are available in orange, blue, red, purple, and green colors.

Using a sparkler ignites it, causing its texture to change. When lit, the sparkler emits colored particles; the durability meter depletes while the sparkler is burning. Sparklers are one of the few items that can be held in the off-hand in Bedrock Edition. Unlit sparklers have normal lighting like most items, while lit sparklers appear to glow when held in the player's hand, similarly to glow sticks.
When the player uses another item while a sparkler is lit, or holds the sparkler in the off-hand, the sparkler's durability stops depleting.
If the player has a lit sparkler in their inventory and goes into the water, the sparkler is destroyed immediately. However, it does not get destroyed if dropped in water. It also cannot float.
Despite having durability, sparklers cannot be enchanted with Unbreaking or Mending.

The formula for sparkler roughly works in real life. Magnesium itself burns white in air, while the metal salts add color to the flame.
