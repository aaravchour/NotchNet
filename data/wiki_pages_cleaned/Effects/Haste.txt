Haste is a status effect that increases attack speed by 10% per level and increases mining speed by 20% per level. Negative levels decrease mining and attack speed, similar to Mining Fatigue.

All mobs are immune to Haste. Most mobs are unaffected by Haste as they cannot mine blocks.

Mining Fatigue III inflicted by elder guardians prevents the player from instant mining most blocks regardless of the Haste effect, along with a huge decrease of mining speed. However, lower levels of Mining Fatigue can be overcome by Haste of level III or greater, with a resultant reduced Haste effect.

At levels 3 until 127 (Java Edition or Bedrock Edition) or 255 (Pocket Edition), the player's arm does not move while mining.
Haste decreases the charging time of sweep attack.
An alternative method of increasing mining speed is the efficiency enchantment.
