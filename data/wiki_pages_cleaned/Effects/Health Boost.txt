Health Boost is an unused status effect that increases a player's (or mob's) maximum health.

Adds 4 maximum health per level. Unlike Absorption, the added hearts are empty at first, but can be healed through the usual methods (such as natural regeneration and the Regeneration and Instant Health effects).
Actual health may be above the base value after the effect ends and are not capped, unless the entity is healed. Extra hearts of a mounted mob can be seen while riding it.
Re-application of the effect when it is still active empties the hearts added by this effect.
When the effect ends, any extra health is lost.

Boss mobs are unaffected.

The maximum health the player can achieve using Health Boost and Absorption is 2068  1034. A player who maximizes health this way, and then adds Regeneration with the level of 255 while healing to 1034 hearts, sees the view jolt, as if taking damage. This also happens when the effect ends.
Applying a high level of this effect and Regeneration to a tamed wolf makes its tail rotate several times, because tamed wolves' tails rotate upward to indicate current health, with no upper bound.
