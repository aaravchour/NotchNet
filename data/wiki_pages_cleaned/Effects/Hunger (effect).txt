Hunger is a status effect which causes the hunger bar to deplete faster than normal.

Hunger increases food exhaustion by 0.005  level per game tick (removes 1 () saturation point every (40  level) seconds). It also turns the hunger bar a yellow-green color(). Negative levels decrease food exhaustion, although they do not increase saturation or the hunger bar.
The status effect does not decrease hunger level on Peaceful, although it does re-color the hunger bar.

Hunger inflicted by eating rotten flesh, raw chicken or by being attacked by a husk adds 3.0 to the player's exhaustion level over the course of 30 seconds, draining 3/4 of a saturation point. When a pufferfish is eaten, 4.5 exhaustion points are added over the course of 15 seconds, draining 1 () and 18 (0.125) saturation points.

Only withers and ender dragons are immune. Only players are affected, as all other mobs do not have hunger.
