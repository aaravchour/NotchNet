Instant Damage is an instant status effect that decreases health for players and living mobs and heals the undead.

Instant Damage inflicts magic damage of 3  2level. Undead mobs (including the wither) are healed as if with Instant Health instead. Death is reported as "<player> was killed by magic". When applied using a lingering potion, damage is inflicted every second. As this is magic damage, it can be decreased only via Resistance and Protection.

Witches are 85% resistant to Instant Damage.
Endermen are immune to Instant Damage from splash potions, lingering potions and tipped arrows, but not from commands.
