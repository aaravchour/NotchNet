Instant Health is an instant status effect that increases health for living mobs and damages the undead.

Instantly heals 2  2level (3  2level).
Undead mobs (including the wither) are damaged as if with Instant Damage, instead. When applied using a lingering potion, the entity is healed every second. Levels 3032 (amplifiers 2931) provide no healing. Levels outside the range 132 (corresponding to amplifiers 031) are used modulo 32, making level 33 the same as level 1, etc.

Only the ender dragon is immune. However, undead mobs are harmed by this effect.
