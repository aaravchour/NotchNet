Luck is a status effect that makes it more likely to receive better loot from certain loot tables, contrary to Bad Luck.

Adds 1  level to attribute generic.luck, making loot table entries with a high quality score more likely, and entries with negative quality less likely. It also increases the chances of bonus_rolls occurring. Currently, only fishing uses quality. The new weight of each entry is floor(base_weight + quality * generic.luck). Negative levels decrease luck.
Using a fishing rod enchanted with Luck of the Sea increases a player's generic.luck attribute, but doesn't actually grant the Luck status effect.

While no mobs, except bosses, are immune to Luck, only players are actually affected.
