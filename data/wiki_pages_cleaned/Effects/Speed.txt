Speed is a status effect that increases an entity's walking speed by 20% multiplied by the effect level.  It expands a player's field of view (FOV) accordingly.  Negative levels decrease speed.

Withers and ender dragons are immune to the Speed effect. While not immune, flying mobs are unaffected by the Speed effect. Shulkers are also unaffected by, though not immune to, Speed.

Alternative methods of traveling more quickly include: sprinting; walking on ice, packed ice or blue ice; riding a horse, pig, or minecart; riding a boat on ice, packed ice, or blue ice; throwing ender pearls; walking on soul soil or soul sand while wearing soul speed boots; or being near a dolphin to gain Dolphin's Grace.
