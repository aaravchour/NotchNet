Wither is a status effect that inflicts damage over time. It acts similarly to Poison, but it acts slower and it can kill.

Wither is an effect that keeps damaging the player as it continues. Unlike Poison, it can affect undead mobs, deals less damage per second, and can kill. It is usually difficult for the player to see how much health they have left, as it turns the player's health bar black.

The amount of damage inflicted to the affected entity is shown in the table below:

The player's hearts turn black ( on Survival mode or  on Hardcore mode), making it more difficult, but still possible, for the player to see their health. Death is reported as "<player> withered away".
Amplifiers outside the range 031 (corresponding to levels 132) use modulo 32.

Wither skeletons, withers and ender dragons are immune to Wither, while witches are 85% resistant to damage from Wither.
