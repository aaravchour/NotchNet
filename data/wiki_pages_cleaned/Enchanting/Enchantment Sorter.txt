The Enchantment Sorter is a machine added by Industrial Foregoing. It is used to sort enchanted items from non-enchanted items. The Enchantment Sorter will accept input of any item, including non-enchantable items, and filter the enchanted items into the top row of output slots while non-enchanted items are pushed to the bottom output slots. Each set of output slots can be assigned a different face of the machine for extraction via pipes or hoppers. Each operation will consume 400 RF from the work energy buffer. This buffer refills at 10 RF/t allowing for one operation every 40 ticks.
