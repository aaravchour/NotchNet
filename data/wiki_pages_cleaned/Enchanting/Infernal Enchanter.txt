The Infernal Enchanter is a functional block added by Better With Mods. It is an advanced Enchanting Table which allows you to select specific enchantments before enchanting using Arcane Scrolls. It requires a large library for the enchanting and can use any bookshelf or other enchanting source within a 17x17x17 cube centered around itself. Upon nearing the Infernal Enchanter it will light up the surrounding area, emit flame particles, and play a blaze sound.
To use the Infernal Enchanter you must first build a suitable library, and then place your desired tool and scroll in the respective slots to be able to select your enchantment. It will not enchant books. As more enchantments are applied to one item, the cost increases and thus requires more bookshelves.
