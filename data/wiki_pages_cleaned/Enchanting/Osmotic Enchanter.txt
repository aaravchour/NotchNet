The Osmotic Enchanter is an enchantment table added by Thaumic Tinkerer. It is similar to a vanilla Enchantment Table except the player is able to choose which enchantment they want. The Osmotic Enchanter needs to be placed close to 6 Obsidian Totem pillars (from 2 to 12 blocks, but size does not affect any technical parts) with a Nitor on top of each pillar. The player also needs a wand that is at least Gold Capped. The Osmotic Enchanter still follows the rules of standard enchanting, meaning that mutually exclusive enchantments cannot be combined (e.g., Fortune and Silk Touch).

This infusion has an instability level of "Dangerous".
