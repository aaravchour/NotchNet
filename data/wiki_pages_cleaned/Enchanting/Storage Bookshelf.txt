The Storage Bookshelf is a block added by Mariculture. It can be used for enchanting similar to a vanilla Bookshelf. However, when broken, the Storage Bookshelf instead returns itself, rather than being broken up into other items. The Storage Bookshelf can also be right-clicked on to open up a 3x3 GUI. This allows the Bookshelf to store up to 9 different items. The Storage Bookshelf can be used to craft several mirrors from the Mariculture mod.
