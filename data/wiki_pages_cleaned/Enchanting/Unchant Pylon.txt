The Unchant Pylon is a tile entity added by Cyclic. It is used to remove enchantments from enchanted items and deposit them into Books. Aside from the item to disenchant, the process requires 5 things:

 Glowstone Dust
 Book
 Redstone
 Bottle o' Enchanting
Redstone Flux
Enchantments are removed one at a time; the enchantment chosen is random.
