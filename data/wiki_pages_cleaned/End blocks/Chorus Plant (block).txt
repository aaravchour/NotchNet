Chorus plants are blocks that naturally generate on the outer islands of the End. They can be grown using chorus flowers.

The block form cannot be obtained in Survival mode, even with the Silk Touch enchantment; however, it is available in the Creative mode inventory.

Chorus plants can be broken using any tool, but an axe is the quickest. Breaking one block of a chorus tree generally causes all chorus plants and flowers above to break due to lack of support. Upon breaking, a chorus plant drops 01 chorus fruit. This is not affected by Fortune.

Chorus plants make up most of the chorus trees that are naturally generated on the outer islands of the End. Chorus trees are typically 1015 blocks in height, although a single plant can reach up to 22 blocks.

Chorus plants are generated as chorus flowers grow.

Chorus plants can be broken to obtain chorus fruit.

Chorus plant blocks break automatically (potentially dropping fruit), if the six surrounding blocks are not valid:

A chorus plant with at least one other chorus plant horizontally adjacent breaks unless at least one of the vertically adjacent blocks is air.
A chorus plant breaks unless the block below is chorus plant or end stone or any horizontally adjacent block is a chorus plant above chorus plant or end stone.

Because breaking one part of the plant breaks all parts above it, cutting a large plant can cause a brief performance drop.
The chorus plant is named due to the sound it makes when it grows.
