Sweet berries are a food item obtained from sweet berry bushes and are used to plant them.
Sweet berry bushes are quick-growing, bonemealable plants that grow sweet berries, and damage and slow players and most mobs moving through them. They can be found naturally in taiga and snowy taiga biomes.

Sweet berry bushes can be mined instantly with any tool or by hand. A mature sweet berry bush yields 23 sweet berries. On its third growth stage, it yields 12 sweet berries. Each level of Fortune can increase the amount of drops by 1.

Berry bushes commonly generate in taiga and snowy taiga biomes. Each chunk has 112 chance to generate sweet berry bushes in random patches. They also generate in both old growth pine taiga and old growth spruce taiga.

Sweet berries can be collected from a sweet berry bush by using or breaking it, which yield 12 sweet berries in its third growth stage, and 23 sweet berries in its final growth stage.

Placing sweet berries on a grass block, dirt, podzol, coarse dirt, farmland, or moss block creates a small sweet berry bush that eventually becomes a fully grown sweet berry bush.

A sweet berry bush grows through four stages after it is planted. Its first growth stage is a small bush without any berries. It becomes a grown plant in its second stage, and produces berries in its third and fourth growth stage. The bush needs to be in light level 9 or greater to grow. Using bone meal on it increases its growth stage by one, and at full maturity, ejects the sweet berry item. The bush can be placed on a 1 block high space, but it cannot grow with a full, non-transparent block immediately above it.

To eat sweet berries, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 / 1.2 hunger saturation.

Placing sweet berries into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Sweet berries can be fed to foxes to breed them. Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the player may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds sweet berries. A baby fox bred by a player trusts the player and does not flee.

Master-level butcher villagers offer to buy 10 sweet berries for an emerald.

A sweet berry bush (at any stage) slows down all entities (except items) passing through it. At stage 1 and higher, it causes damage. Foxes are immune to both characteristics, however. Sweet berry bushes deal 1 damage every 0.5 seconds, only if the entity is moving in the hitbox of the bush. Entities that move through sweet berry bushes slow down to about 34.05% of their normal speed, similar to how a cobweb slows down mobs to 15% of normal speed. This makes it impossible to jump a full block while inside the bush.
Mobs at standard block height in a minecart are not damaged when the minecart is pushed through sweet berries. Players in a sweet berry bush take no damage except from horizontal movement, but are unable to jump out of the bush, similar to a cobweb.

Bees pollinate sweet berry bushes, and then increase the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.

In Java Edition, sweet berry bushes absorb fall damage like water.
Foxes harvest mature sweet berry bushes that have grown into their third or fourth stage. Unlike how carrots eaten by rabbits are destroyed and not dropped as items, sweet berry bushes harvested by foxes drop as items, although the fox may pick up one of the dropped berries. The bush remains intact, allowing for automatic sweet berry farms.
