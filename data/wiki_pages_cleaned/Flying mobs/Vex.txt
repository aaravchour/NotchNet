The vex is a small flying hostile mob. It wields an iron sword, can phase through walls, and is only summoned as one of the evoker's attacks. They attack by lunging at their targets with their sword.

Vexes spawn as part of an evoker's summoning attack: The evoker is surrounded by white particles and makes a magical, horn-like sound. Then, a group of three vexes appears near the evoker. The evoker can summon additional vexes even if some still remain alive from the last summoning.
The vex never spawns naturally, although it can be spawned using spawn eggs or via commands.

In Java Edition, the vex's iron sword does not drop, because its main hand's HandDropChances is 0.  
In Bedrock Edition, the vex can drop its iron sword with random durability. This is not affected by the Looting enchantment.
5 is dropped when a vex is killed by a player or tamed wolf.

Vexes attack players, adult villagers, iron golems, and wandering traders if an evoker summoned them, and any other target as commanded by their summoning evoker (any mob that attacks the evoker accidentally or purposefully, or any mob that illagers naturally attack on sight). They still attack these mobs even when they do not have a weapon. Despite this, they deal the same amount of damage. 
Vexes are capable of flying through the air, and can freely pass through any solid block, including water and lava, without taking damage. This means they can also pass through bedrock, meaning it is possible for them to die in the Void. While vexes can pass through blocks easily, honey blocks slow them down like other entities. Vexes also can be bounced back when pushed by a slime block.
While attacking, vexes glow red and lunge at their target. They often fly towards the back of their targets and attack them from behind, making it difficult to block their attacks with a shield.
Vexes do not count towards the bossbar during a raid.
If any mob attacks a vex, any vexes in the area become hostile toward it. This includes vindicators named "Johnny" that attack them, despite both being allied with the illagers.
Vexes summoned by an evoker start taking damage after 30 to 119 seconds and eventually die. Vexes summoned by a spawner, spawn egg or by the /summon command don't take damage this way.
A vex does not despawn if it has a custom name or if it is in a block, minecart, or boat.
When idle, vexes wander within a 151115 cuboid range centered on their evoker's position, unless summoned by a spawn egg or by the /summon command. This happens when the vexes killed the mob that their evoker commanded them to.

Issues relating to "Vex" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

Despite their ghostly appearances and their ability to phase through walls, vexes are not undead mobs.
According to JAPPA, the retexturing and remodeling of vexes was a long time in the making due to being requested too much.
Vexes are heavily implied to be allays that have been corrupted by dark magic.
