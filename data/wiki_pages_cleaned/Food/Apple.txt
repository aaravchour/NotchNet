Apples are food items that can be eaten by the player.

Oak and dark oak leaves have 0.5% (1200) chance of dropping an apple when decayed or broken, but not if burned. Breaking leaves with a tool enchanted with the Fortune enchantment increases the chances of dropping an apple: 0.556% (1180) with Fortune I, 0.625% (1160) with Fortune II, and 0.833% (1120) with Fortune III.

Apprentice-level farmer villagers have a 50% (12) or 66.7% (23) chance of selling 4 apples as part of their trades.

To eat an apple, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 4 () hunger and 2.4 saturation.

Placing an apple into a composter has a 65% (1320) chance of raising the compost level by 1.
