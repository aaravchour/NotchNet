A golden carrot is a valuable food item and brewing ingredient. It provides the second most saturation in the game, behind suspicious stew crafted with either a dandelion or blue orchid.

Master-level farmer villagers have a 50% chance to sell 3 golden carrots for 3 emeralds in Bedrock Edition, and always offer the same trade in Java Edition.

To eat a golden carrot, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 6 () and 14.4 saturation points. 

Golden carrots are used to tame, breed, lead, grow, and heal horses, donkeys, and mules, and to breed, lead, and grow rabbits.
