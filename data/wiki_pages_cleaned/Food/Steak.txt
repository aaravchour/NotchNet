Steak (in Java Edition) or cooked beef (in Bedrock Edition) is a food item obtained from cows, mooshrooms, or from cooking raw beef.

When a cow or mooshroom is killed, it drops raw beef. If a cow dies while on fire, it drops steak instead. If the cow is killed using a weapon with the Looting enchantment, the maximum number of steak drops increases by 1 per level.

Raw beef can be cooked in a furnace, smoker, or campfire. Each steak removed from a furnace output slot gives 0.35 experience (22.4 experience per stack).

In Java Edition, butcher villagers may give players steak if they have the Hero of the Village status effect.

To eat steak, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 8 () hunger and 12.8 hunger 
saturation. 

Steak can be used to breed and heal tamed wolves, lead them around, and make baby tamed wolves grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.
