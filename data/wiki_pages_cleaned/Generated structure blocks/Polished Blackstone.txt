Polished blackstone is the stone-like polished variation of blackstone.
 Chiseled polished blackstone is the chiseled variation of polished blackstone.

Polished blackstone has a slightly higher hardness (thus takes slightly longer to break) than its chiseled variant.

Polished blackstone can generate as part of bastion remnants and ruined portals in the Nether.

Polished blackstone can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sound.
