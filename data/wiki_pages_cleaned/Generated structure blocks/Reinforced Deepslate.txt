Reinforced deepslate is a block that generates exclusively in ancient cities. It has high hardness, is immune to explosions, and cannot be obtained in Survival mode.

Reinforced deepslate is not obtainable in Survival, even with Silk Touch, and is only available through the Creative inventory or commands. It cannot be pushed by a piston, is highly blast resistant, has higher hardness than obsidian, and cannot be destroyed by the wither or the ender dragon.
Reinforced deepslate has no tool associated with it, meaning it is mined at the exact same speed regardless of the tool and level of efficiency.

56 blocks of reinforced deepslate are found in the central part of each ancient city, creating a portal-like frame structure.
