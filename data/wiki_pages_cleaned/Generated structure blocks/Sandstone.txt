Sandstone is a solid block commonly found in deserts and beaches underneath sand.
Red sandstone is a related block, associated with red sand.

Sandstone can be mined with any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, the block drops nothing.

Regular sandstone generates in deserts and beaches, compressed underneath multiple blocks of sand. Regular sandstone generates at noise cave entrances in desert and beach biomes, and red sandstone generates at noise cave entrances in badlands biomes.
If a village generates some buildings inside of a badlands biome, any floating platform surrounding village buildings generate with red sandstone below red sand.
Many structures that generate in deserts are made of sandstone. Desert wells are made of normal sandstone, desert villages made of normal, cut, and smooth sandstone, and desert pyramids are made of normal, cut, and chiseled sandstone. Additionally, warm underwater ruins are made predominantly of sandstone variants. All of these structures use sandstone blocks, slabs, stairs, and walls. No naturally generated structures are made of red sandstone.

Unlike sand, sandstone is never affected by gravity.

All types of sandstone can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
