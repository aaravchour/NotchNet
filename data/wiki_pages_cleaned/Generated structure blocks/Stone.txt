Stone is a block found underground in the Overworld or on the surface of mountains.

Stone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops cobblestone. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. If a stone is mined with a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe, it drops itself.

Stone makes up the majority of the solid blocks generated in the Overworld above y=0. From y=8 downwards, stone gradually transitions into deepslate, until it is completely replaced by deepslate at and below y=0.
When chunks generate, stone can be found under 1-5 layers of grass blocks, dirt, gravel, clay, coarse dirt, podzol, mycelium, sand, sandstone, red sand, red sandstone, or terracotta, depending on the biome. 
When the world is generating new chunks, some stone is replaced with ore features of other blocks. They may also be revealed on the side of small hills.
Stone also generates in igloo basements, some Overworld ruined portals, and in trail ruins.
Stone also makes up most of the blocks on the void start platform, in Superflat worlds created with the Void biome preset.

Stone can also be made by lava flowing on top of water blocks (both flowing and source). The water is replaced by stone.

Stone can be smelted from cobblestone.

Silverfish can enter and hide in stone, creating an infested block.

Apprentice-level stone mason villagers offer to buy 20 stone for an emerald.

Stone can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
