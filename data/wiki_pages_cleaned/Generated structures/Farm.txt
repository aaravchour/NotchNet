A farm is a generated structure in a village used for growing various crops.

Farms generate naturally in villages. All farms generate with farmland blocks, water, and at least one composter (with rare exceptions). Most farms generate with crops, mostly wheat, but melons, pumpkins, and carrots may also be found.
In addition, village farm plots have a 20% chance to generate with potatoes planted, and a 10% chance to generate with beetroot planted.

A player may create a working crop farm in any biome in the Overworld or The End. A farm needs only a water source block near to farmland blocks, which are created by using a hoe on dirt blocks. Given sufficient light, seeds or other crops may then be planted on the farmland and grown to maturity for harvesting.

While a village farm is a good ready-made source of food, a village is not required for farming crops. A player with access to water, dirt or grass blocks, and a hoe may create a farm anywhere.
For a typical early-game survival farm, a player uses a hoe to create farmland within four blocks of water, and then plants seeds that were harvested from breaking tall grass. The seeds eventually grow into wheat after a few day-night cycles. Once the crops have matured, they can be harvested and then used for food, trading, leading livestock, breeding livestock, or breeding villagers.
Farmer villagers use a farm's composter as a job site. Farmer villagers can also be seen occasionally harvesting crops.

Farms generate in different configurations depending on the biome. Some farms have irregular shapes that can vary from the configurations shown below. As seen on the right, it is possible for a minimal farm to generate naturally with one water block and eight farmland blocks.
As shown in the sections below, additional resources that make up the structure are available beyond the farmland, water, and composter blocks found in all farms.
