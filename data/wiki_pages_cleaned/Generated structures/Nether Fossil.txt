Nether fossils are fossils that generate in soul sand valleys.

Nether fossils generate randomly throughout the Nether in soul sand valleys.

Nether fossils are composed of 5 to 27 bone blocks. Unlike Overworld fossils, they do not have a lowered structure integrity and no blocks are replaced with coal or diamond ore. They are made with the NBT structure block format and the NBT files for each fossil are stored in the folder minecraft.jar/data/minecraft/structures/nether_fossils.
