This page documents Java Edition's several historical leaf decay algorithms.

Leaves will NOT decay if:

They are within a 5x5x2 box around a log with the log in the bottom center. (Note that the leaf does not have to touch the log)
They are on top of a solid block.
They are on top of a leaf that is unable to decay due to the reasons above.
If these conditions are not met, the leaf decays.

In Alpha, leaves would decay using an algorithm that checks whether it has a solid or leaf block underneath it or is adjacent to a solid block. If it doesn't, it must be connected to a leaf block that is also supported as long as it is no further than five blocks away from said support.
