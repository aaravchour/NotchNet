This page attempts to document the full history of the textures of blocks, their additions, changes, and removals. Additions and changes made to the models of blocks and any new blocks that reuse prior textures will not be documented here. Texture files that are completely identical to other texture files will also be largely ignored for the time being.

These textures are also used for blocks. However, the blocks in question render as entities rather than blocks. As such, the textures they use are much more akin to entity textures.

These textures were released as one of the two Texture Update resource packs but have never appeared in a full version.
Note: this section only includes textures that are exclusive to the Texture Update preview resource packs. Unchanged textures from before which were included with the pack, as well as textures that went on to make it into the game officially, are not currently included.

These textures only existed in specific joke versions and never appeared in official releases.

These textures are not used directly for any blocks but are instead used for defining particles they emit upon being broken, fallen on, or sprinted on.

This section documents both placeholder textures for errors, and those formerly used for animated blocks.
