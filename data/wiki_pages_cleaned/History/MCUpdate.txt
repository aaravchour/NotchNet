MCUpdate is a Tumblr blog that hosted Minecraft version changes and updates for the old launcher client. The blog also displayed major events such as MINECON Earth and some information from the Mojang blog. The right side contains a list of the employees, official links, and a link to the Minecraft Forums.
The blog, while still available, is no longer in use as all updates have been posted on the Minecraft website since December 21, 2016.
The latest blog post contains info about the end of support for Windows XP and Vista in Q2 2021.
