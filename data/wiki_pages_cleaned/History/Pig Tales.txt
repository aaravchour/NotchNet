Pig Tales was a mini site within Minecraft.net that allowed users to create and share their own conversations that starred two Minecraft Pig sock puppets known as Pig #1 and Pig #2 in front of an obviously fake set. The conversation ended with a dramatic zoom-in on Pig #1. The films were made in retro style and were "produced" by a fake Swedish company called Mackapar Films.
The mini site was set up on August 22, 2011 and on August 26th, the Pig Tales conversation was revealed. These Minecraft socks were made by a Swedish company called Happy Socks and were listed on their website here.
As of the Minecraft.net 2.0 Redesign, this site is no longer available. An archived version is available here.

The video Pig Tales was based on was uploaded by a YouTube user named BengtAndRon but the video itself, titled "Encounter in the Park" is unlisted.
An archived version is available here.

The man "acting" (holding the socks) was Jeb.
A behind the scenes video was also uploaded to the Minecraft Youtube channel.
Mackapr is actually a Swedish word for gadget, which is a synonym to the word mojng.
The video shown was not an actual YouTube video, but rather a .swf flash animation.
Mackapar Film was also credited in a video promoting the original Lego Minecraft set.
Mackapar Media was the name of a company that produced some of the in-game technology in the cancelled Mojang game 0x10c.
