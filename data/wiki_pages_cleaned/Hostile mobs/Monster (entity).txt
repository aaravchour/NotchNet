Monsters were hostile mobs that look identical to the players with the default skin.

Monsters were only spawnable using mods and map editors, but otherwise were not available in vanilla Minecraft.

Monsters did not drop anything when they die.

Monsters would hurt and kill the player, dealing the same damage to the player as the player does with their fist. Strangely, they did not use the punching animation that a normal player would use; they would only run into the player like a zombie would.

Monsters, when spawned, may head to the left for half a second, before turning around to attack the player. Zombified piglins may also do this on occasion.
If a monster spawner with monster is placed in Java Edition Beta 1.8 or later, it appears blank and no monsters spawn.
Coding for monsters was still present until Java Edition 1.8. Only the monster model was removed in Beta 1.8.
Monsters use the old player model, so they are actually slightly taller than the player.
Despite being taller than the player, monsters looked up at the player when chasing them. This is because their actual hit-box and eye height were shorter than the player's hit-box and eye height.
Notch also used the name "monster" for the green moboids in his unfinished game: Legend of the Chambered.
