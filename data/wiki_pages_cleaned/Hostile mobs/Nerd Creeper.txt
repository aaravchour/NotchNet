The nerd creeper was a hostile creeper-based mob present in the April Fool's Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34 update.

Nerd creepers spawn when the player uses the cheat code "NEEEERD".
Creepers in this version have an NBT tag called  d20 (1 = true/0 = false) that determines whether the creeper is a nerd.
A nerd creeper can be summoned with the following command: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {d20:1}

When killed, nerd creepers drop: 

5 experience points, if killed by the player or a tamed wolf.
1 3D item.
1 music disc at random, if killed by a skeleton or stray.
1 creeper head, if killed by a charged creeper.

Nerd creepers, effectively being a reskinned creeper, shared almost all of their behavior, except when killed, they dropped the 3D item instead of gunpowder.
