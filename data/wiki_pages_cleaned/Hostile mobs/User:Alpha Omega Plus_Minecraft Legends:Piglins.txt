Piglins are a species of hostile pig-like mobs from the Nether who have invaded the Overworld and are the main antagonists of Minecraft Legends.

Piglins originate from the infernal realm of the Nether and came to the Overworld to conquer and spread corruption on its surface. They live in a structure society as they are all under the leadership of a grand chief and are divided into several hordes each led by a chief. All the hordes are distinct by both appearance and behavior, and have their own varieties of piglins.
