Invalid data value blocks of quartz are item forms of the block of quartz with damage values outside of the usual range which blocks of quartz can usually be obtained in.

Without the use of commands, invalid data value blocks of quartz are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

Blocks of quartz with metadata 3 and 4 correspond to quartz pillars facing sideways directions. The ability to place blocks of quartz sideways was added in 13w03a, and was impossible in 13w02a, making these metadata values unused in said versions. If quartz pillars are placed sideways in 13w03a or a later version and the world is then loaded in 13w02a or 13w02b, the sideways quartz pillars (which will look like normal quartz blocks in these older versions) can be broken to obtain quartz block items with damage values 3 and 4.

Block transmutation with doors can be used to obtain blocks of quartz with metadata 5 to 7, and with arrows can be used to obtain blocks with metadata 5 to 15. These blocks can be mined in 14w21b or earlier to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.

From 13w02a to 14w21b, invalid data value blocks of quartz would place the block that corresponds to the item form. Unlike invalid data value logs, this includes the two data values that correspond to rotated pillars, meaning that one of these two items will always place a sideways quartz pillar regardless of the player's facing direction or the targeted block face.
From 14w25a to 17w46a, invalid data value blocks of quartz will always place a normal block of quartz, including those that previously had the data of rotated pillars.

Placed form
As invalid data blocks were effectively deleted in 1.8, considerably before invalid data value items, the block form is documented in the section below.

Invalid data value blocks of quartz are an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.
