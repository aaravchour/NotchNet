Invalid data value cobblestone walls are item forms of the cobblestone wall block with damage values outside of the usual range which cobblestone walls can usually be obtained in.

Without the use of commands, invalid data value cobblestone walls are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

Block transmutation with doors can be used to obtain cobblestone walls with metadata 4 and 5, and with arrows any metadata from 2 to 15 can be obtained. These blocks can be mined in 14w21b or earlier to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.
For arrow transmutation, the initial block being transmuted must be a non-mossy cobblestone wall, i.e. a cobblestone wall block with metadata value 0. Mossy cobblestone walls cannot be transmuted. Any connections a cobblestone wall has to adjacent blocks are irrelevant, as these are not controlled by metadata.

Invalid data value cobblestone walls are an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.
