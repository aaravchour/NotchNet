Invalid data value logs are unobtainable item forms of the primary log block with damage values outside of the usual range which logs can usually be obtained in.

Without the use of commands, invalid data value logs are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

Prior to 12w30d (the first version in which logs could be placed sideways), if a log block with an invalid data value exists inside of the world, it can be broken to obtain a log item of that data value. Such blocks can be obtained through block transmutation, with liquid transmutation being the most versatile.
In 12w30d and 12w30e, a tool enchanted with Silk Touch can be used to obtain an invalid data value log item if a sideways log is broken with it.

From 12w30d to 14w21b, invalid data value log items will place the log corresponding to their species. The directionality of the item is ignored; the item will be placed as if it were a normal log item. This also means that "wood" items will place a log rather than wood.
Attempting to place any log, regardless of data value, will immediately crash the game in 14w25a.
From 14w25b to 17w46a, the pre-14w25a behaviour can be seen again.

In 1.13 (17w47a) onwards, distinguishing between block and item variants using metadata and damage was formally abolished. As a result of this, existing items would be converted over to the new ID system automatically. Invalid data value logs behave anomalously in that instead of converting to their respective parent species, they all convert to oak logs instead. In addition, items with data values 12 to 15, which represent wood rather than logs, still become logs.

Inventory appearances

Invalid data value logs are an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.
