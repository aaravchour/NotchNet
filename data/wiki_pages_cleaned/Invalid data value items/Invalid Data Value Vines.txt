Invalid data value vines are item forms of the vines block with damage values outside of the usual range which vines can usually be obtained in.

Without the use of commands, invalid data value vines are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

From Beta 1.8 to Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5, invalid data value vines were obtainable via breaking any existing vines block with shears. The data value of vines dropped would correspond to the data value of the block it came from, allowing 15 different variations to be obtained, while also rendering the default item with data value 0 completely unobtainable due to it corresponding to a vines block with no connections. The "up" state is ignored due to not being determined by metadata. As multiple vines cannot be manually placed into the same space in this version, they should instead be positioned above each other and given time to grow into a block space corresponding to the desired data value.

From Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 onwards, breaking vines would always return an item with damage value 0, rendering invalid data values unobtainable.

As vines as an item do not track their damage value for any purpose, invalid data value vines can be created by picking up dropped normal vines with an incomplete stack of invalid data value vines already in the inventory, as well as merging together existing item stacks. This can also result in invalid data value vines being converted to non-anomalous vines in the same way, and therefore care should be taken when transporting such items. As such, if collection of all 15 different types of vines is desired, they should be stored in a storage container such as a chest in different slots via manual placement - shift-clicking should be avoided.

Invalid data value vines are an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.
