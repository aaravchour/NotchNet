A baked potato is a food item that can be eaten by the player.

Baked potatoes can be obtained by cooking potatoes in a furnace, smoker, or campfire.

In Java Edition, baked potatoes can also be obtained by killing a zombie or one of its variants while it is on fire. The drop chance is still affected by Looting.

To eat a baked potato, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 5 () hunger and 6.0 hunger saturation.

Placing a baked potato into a composter has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. This is more efficient than composting with raw potatoes.
