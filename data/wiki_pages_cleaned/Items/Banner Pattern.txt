Banner patterns are a set of 10 items used to customize banners inside looms.

6 out of 10 banner patterns can be obtained by crafting. They are crafted by combining one paper along with a certain material.

Globe banner pattern is obtained by trading with a master-level cartographer villager for a price of 8 emeralds.

Flow and guster banner patterns are obtained in the trial chambers as loot from different vaults:

Banner patterns are used in looms to add customization to banners. The pattern must be combined with 1 banner and 1 dye. Upon usage in the loom, the banner pattern is not consumed.
