Blaze powder is an item made from a blaze rod, which is dropped by a blaze when killed. Its main uses are to fuel brewing stands, to brew strength potions, and to make eyes of ender to take the player to the End.

In addition to being a brewing ingredient, blaze powder is needed to fuel a brewing stand. Each piece of blaze powder can brew up to 20 batches of potions.
