Blaze rods are items exclusively obtained from blazes. They act as a fuel for both brewing and smelting, and are required to craft eyes of ender used to access to the End.

When killed by a player or tamed wolf, a blaze has a 50% chance to drop a blaze rod. The Looting enchantment can increase the drops by one per level, for a maximum of 4 blaze rods. Blazes do not drop any blaze rods if killed by any other source.

When used in a furnace, a blaze rod lasts 120 seconds (12 items).

Note: This video does not mention the crafting of End Rods.

As part of an official collaboration, blaze rods are included in a free add-on for the roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. In the game, they are worth 100 gold pieces, create light, and can be broken to create an explosion.
They are the spinning things surrounding the blaze's head.
