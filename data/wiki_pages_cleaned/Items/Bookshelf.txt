Bookshelves are blocks that improve enchantments applied with an enchanting table when placed around one, up to a maximum of fifteen bookshelves, at the expense of level requirement.

Bookshelves can generate in village libraries and village houses. The chance for a bookshelf to generate in a village house is 20.82%
Strongholds may contain up to two libraries, each of which may be single-level or have an upper balcony. These feature some bookshelves arranged in pillars, and more bookshelves arranged in pillars in the walls. Single-level libraries contain 161 bookshelves, while libraries with balconies contain 233.
Bookshelves also naturally generate in certain woodland mansion rooms.

Bookshelves can be broken fairly easily by hand, but can be broken faster by using an axe. In either case, they drop 3 books when broken, allowing the reconstruction of the bookshelf with the addition of six wood planks. When broken by an item that is enchanted with Silk Touch, a bookshelf drops itself.

If an enchanting table is placed near a bookshelf, glyph particles fly from the bookshelf toward the enchanting table. Having bookshelves in the proper position near the table allows the table to apply higher-level enchantments.
