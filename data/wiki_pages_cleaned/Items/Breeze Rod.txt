Breeze rods are items exclusively obtained from the breeze, which is found in the trial chambers. They can be crafted into 4 wind charges, crafted into the mace with the heavy core as well as repairing the mace in an anvil, duplicating the flow armor trim, and brewed into a potion of Wind Charging.

Breezes will drop 1-3 breeze rods without looting, 2-4 rods with looting I, 3-6 rods with looting II, and 5-7 rods with looting III. Breeze rods also have a 11.5% chance to drop from regular vaults and a 5.5% chance to drop from ominous vaults.

Breeze rods are used to craft 4 wind charges, the mace using the heavy core, and the flow armor trim.
