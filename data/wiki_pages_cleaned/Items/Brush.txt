A brush is a tool used in archaeology to excavate suspicious blocks for different items, or obtain scutes from an armadillo.

Using the brush on any block displays a brushing animation, slowing down the player and creating breaking particles, but not actually damaging the block or brush. When continuously brushing a suspicious block, a random item slowly emerges from it until it drops out, and the block turns into regular sand or regular gravel, depleting 1 durability point on the brush. It takes 96 game ticks (4.8 seconds) to brush a single suspicious block. 

Using it on an armadillo will deplete 13 durability points, and drop an armadillo scute. There is no cooldown for brushing armadillos, neither a limit for how many scutes can be dropped by a single armadillo.
