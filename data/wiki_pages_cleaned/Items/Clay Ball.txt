A clay ball is the item obtained from clay used for crafting or making bricks.

Clay balls are obtained when a clay block is broken with a non-Silk Touch tool. Each block yields four clay balls regardless of Fortune.

If a player has the Hero of the Village status effect, a Mason villager might throw that player a clay block as a gift.  This can be placed and broken to harvest clay balls.

Clay balls can be crafted back together to form clay blocks or baked in a furnace to create bricks.

Novice-level mason villagers buy 10 clay balls for 1 emerald as part of their trades.
