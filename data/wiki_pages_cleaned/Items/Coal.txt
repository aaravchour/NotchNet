Coal is a mineral item mainly obtained from coal ore. It is primarily used for crafting torches and campfires, as well as fuel.

Coal ore are mined using a pickaxe and drops 1 piece of coal. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it may drop an extra piece per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of 4 with Fortune III.

Wither skeletons have a 13 chance of dropping a single coal upon death. The maximum amount of coal is increased by 1 per level of Looting. The chance of a wither skeleton not dropping any coal can be found using the formula 2 / (Looting Level + 3). For example, Looting III gives a 13 chance of not dropping any coal. All other amounts have an equal chance of occurring.

When used in a furnace as a fuel, a piece of coal lasts 80 seconds (smelting up to 8 items), like charcoal. Coal used as fuel lasts more than 5 times longer than wood planks or wood logs used as fuel, being more efficient than any other use of wood for smelting in Java Edition, but outstripped by wooden slabs in Bedrock Edition. 
Coal and charcoal are also the only fuels accepted by furnace minecarts. They provide approximately four minutes of transit each.
