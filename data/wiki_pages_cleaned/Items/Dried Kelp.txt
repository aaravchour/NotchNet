Dried kelp is a food item that can be quickly eaten by the player. It can also be crafted into dried kelp blocks.

Kelp can be cooked in a furnace, smoker, or campfire. Each piece of dried kelp removed from a furnace output slot gives 0.1 experience (6.4 experience per stack).

To eat dried kelp, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 1 () hunger and 0.6 / 0.2 hunger saturation.
A player can consume dried kelp about twice as fast as any other food item in the game.

Dried kelp placed into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
