Feathers are items dropped by chickens and parrots, as well as tamed cats as morning gifts.

Adult chickens drop 02 feathers upon death. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 05 with Looting III.
Parrots drop 12 feathers upon death. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 15 with Looting III.
A fox sometimes spawns holding a feather, which always drops upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item, causing the fox to drop the feather in favor of the food.

Tamed cats have a 70% chance of giving the player a "morning gift", and the gift has a 16.13% chance to be a feather.

While a feather cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear completely upright unlike other items.

Expert-level fletcher villagers buy 24 feathers for an emerald as part of their trade.
