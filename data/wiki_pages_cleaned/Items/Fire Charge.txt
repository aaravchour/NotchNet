Fire charges are items that can be used as a single-use version of a flint and steel or shot as a small fireball from a dispenser.

Piglins may barter 1 fire charge when given a gold ingot.

Fire charges can be used as ammunition for dispensers, or as a substitute for flint and steel.
When used, it instantly places a fire, similar to flint and steel. The fire charge is consumed in the process. It can prime TNT, light nether portals, campfires, candles, cakes with candles and creepers like flint and steel.
When a fire charge is fired from a dispenser, it shoots a small fireball.
