In Survival mode, firework stars are obtainable only through crafting. In Creative mode, they can be found in the creative inventory.

The only usage of firework stars is to create firework rockets.

A firework star can have only one shape effect.

In addition to the shape effects, any combination of these additional effects may be added to a firework star.
