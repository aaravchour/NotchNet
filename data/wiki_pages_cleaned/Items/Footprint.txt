The Footprint was a joke item from Java Edition 20w14, found only in the missing dimension.

This item is semi-transparent with a grey colour scheme.

Footprints were obtained only from a chest in the missing dimension. Only existing in 2020 April fools snapshot 20w14, it cannot exist in any non-April Fool's joke versions and April Fool's joke versions before or after 20w14. There is a maximum of 2 footprints that can be obtained legitimately in any given world.

Despite these footprints not being available in the creative inventory, it is still possible to acquire them via the command give <target> minecraft:footprint <amount> or duplicating them by holding down middle-click whilst in creative mode.

As of snapshot 20w14, this item cannot be placed or used in any way other than a trophy. This item can be inserted and/or rotated inside of an item frame, and it has a stack limit of 64.

This is a reference to the removed "Footstep" particle, hence in the "missing" dimension.
This item is intended as a joke directed towards the commands' community where the "Footstep" particle is commonly requested.
