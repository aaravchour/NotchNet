Ghast tears are items dropped by ghasts. They can be used to make potions of Regeneration, end crystals and Dried Ghasts.

Ghasts drop 01 ghast tears. Looting increases the maximum ghast tears dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 4 ghast tears with Looting III. Looting also works when knocking back a fireball with an enchanted item.

(Dried Ghast recipe needed here: 8 Ghast tears and 1 Soul Sand)
