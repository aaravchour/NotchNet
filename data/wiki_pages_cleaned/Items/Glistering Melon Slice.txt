A glistering melon slice is an inedible item used for brewing potions of Healing. It is also one of the many potion ingredients that can be used to make mundane potions.

Master-level farmer villagers sell 3 glistering melon for 4 emeralds.

Despite being crafted with a melon slice, a glistering melon slice cannot be eaten, unlike a golden apple or golden carrot.

Piglins are attracted to glistering melon slices. They run toward any glistering melon slice on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.
