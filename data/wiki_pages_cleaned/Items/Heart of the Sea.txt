A heart of the sea is a rare item that can be crafted into a conduit.

The heart of the sea must be found. It cannot be crafted or obtained by trading, making it a non-renewable resource.
A heart of the sea is obtained from a buried treasure. The location is marked with a noticeable red X on a buried treasure map, which is found in ocean ruins and shipwrecks. Feeding raw cod or raw salmon to a dolphin causes the dolphin to swim toward the nearest buried treasure, shipwreck, or ocean ruins.

Before the heart of the sea was added to Bedrock Edition, there was an entry found in the buried treasure chest loot table named nautilus_core, which was later revealed to be the heart of the sea. Despite the name change, the heart of the sea continues to be referred to as the nautilus_core in most game files.
