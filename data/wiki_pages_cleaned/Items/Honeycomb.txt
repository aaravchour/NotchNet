Honeycombs are items obtained from bee nests and beehives.

When a bee nest or beehive at honey_level 5 is sheared, it drops 3 honeycombs and angers any bees inside, causing them to attack. Having a lit campfire or lighting a fire underneath the nest or hive prevents the bees from becoming hostile.
A dispenser with shears inside can be used to shear the nest or hive without angering the bees. A honeycomb item drops out after using the shears.

Using a honeycomb on a sign or a hanging sign prevents the sign from being edited.

Using a honeycomb on a block of copper and its cut copper, cut copper slab, cut copper stairs, grate, door, trapdoor, and bulb variants change the block into theirs waxed variant, preventing oxidation of the copper.
