Iron nuggets are pieces of iron that can be obtained by smelting iron tools/weapons or iron/chainmail armor. One iron nugget is worth one-ninth of an iron ingot.

Durability and enchantments do not affect the ability to smelt iron tools, weapons, or armor into iron nuggets.

Piglins may barter 936 iron nuggets when given a gold ingot.

Iron nuggets are used to craft iron ingots, lanterns, soul lanterns, and chains.
