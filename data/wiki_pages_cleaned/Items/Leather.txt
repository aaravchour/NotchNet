Leather is an item used to make item frames, armor and books.

Upon death, cows, mooshrooms, horses, donkeys, mules, llamas and trader llamas drop 02 leather, while hoglins drop 01 leather. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 leather (4 leather from hoglins) with Looting III.
A fox sometimes spawns holding leather, which always drops upon death. Alternatively, a player can drop a food item, causing the fox to drop the leather.

Leather can be obtained as a "junk" item from fishing.
