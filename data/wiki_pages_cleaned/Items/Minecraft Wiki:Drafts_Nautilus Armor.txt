The nautilus armor is a special type of armor that can be worn by a nautilus or a zombie nautilus. They cannot be crafted and can only be obtained via treasure chests and ocean ruins.

Nautilus Armor can be obtained via looting Buried Treasure and ocean ruins. They can also be obtained by shearing them off of a zombie nautilus jockey, if the zombie nautilus spawns armored.
Copper nautilus armor does not oxidize, unlike most copper variants.

Like any diamond equipments, a diamond nautilus armor can be upgraded to a netherite nautilus armor via a netherite upgrade.

Tamed nautili and zombie nautili can wear nautilus armor, but baby nautili cannot be equipped with nautilus armor.

Nautilus armor has iron, gold, copper, diamond and netherite variants. However, nautilus armor does not have a chainmail variant.

Nautilus armor can be equipped to nautiluses by right-clicking the nautilus with it.
There is a gradual increase in the defense given from a nautilus wearing the different types of armor. Note that golden nautilus armor provides more protection than iron nautilus armor, whereas the opposite is true for player armor.

When a nautilus dies while equipped with any nautilus armor tier, it drops its normal loot, saddle (if it had one), and the nautilus armor.

Unlike player armor, nautilus armor does not have durability. This means a single nautilus armor can be used infinitely unless destroyed.

Unlike all nautilus armor tiers, netherite nautilus armor is inflammable. So it floats in lava.

Piglins are attracted to golden nautilus armor and run toward any golden nautilus armor on the ground, inspecting it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.
