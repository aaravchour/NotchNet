A nautilus shell is an item that is used for crafting conduits.

Nautilus shells can be rarely obtained as a treasure item from fishing. The drop chances of nautilus shells slightly increase with each level of Luck of the Sea on the player's fishing rod.

Drowned have a 3% or 8% chance to spawn with a nautilus shell in their off-hand, and this nautilus shell always drops upon death.

Wandering traders may sell a nautilus shell for 5 emeralds each, but they only sell 5 of them at a time.

In Bedrock Edition, a nautilus shell is one of the few items that can be held in the off-hand.

Nautiluses are animals that occupy deep oceans in the real world. However, they will appear to Minecraft in an upcoming game drop as a mob.
Because Bedrock Edition allows for Nautilus shells to be held in the off-hand (since drowned hold them), they are the only item in that version that can be put in the off-hand slot without having a specific function.
