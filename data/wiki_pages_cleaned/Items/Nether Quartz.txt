Nether quartz is a white mineral found in the Nether.

Nether quartz ore mined using a pickaxe drops one unit of Nether quartz. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it may drop an extra unit per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of four with Fortune III. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Silk Touch, the ore drops itself.

Piglins may barter 512 Nether quartz when given a gold ingot.

Expert-level stone mason villagers have a 133 chance to trade one emerald for 12 Nether quartz in Java Edition. This trade is always offered in Bedrock Edition.
