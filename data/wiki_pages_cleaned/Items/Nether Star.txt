The Nether Star is a rare item dropped by the wither that is used solely to craft Beacons.

The nether star can be obtained only by defeating the Wither boss, which is created using Soul sand and Wither Skeleton Skulls. One nether star is dropped each time; the dropped amount is not affected by the Looting enchantment. In Java Edition, nether stars dropped by withers take 10 minutes to despawn and are immune to explosions. In Bedrock Edition, nether star items never despawn, neither by time nor by explosions.

The nether star has the same animated glint as enchanted items, potions, and end crystals.
A dropped nether star item cannot be destroyed by explosions. However, it can still be destroyed by a falling anvil, fire, lava, cacti, or the Void.
It is used to craft a beacon.
