Netherite ingots are items obtained from crafting netherite scraps and gold ingots together, as well as loot from bastion remnant loot chests. Unlike other items, they are immune to fire and lava damage. They are primarily used to upgrade diamond gear.

Netherite ingots are obtained by crafting four netherite scraps and four gold ingots. It is a shapeless recipe, therefore the placement of the netherite scraps and gold ingots does not matter when crafting it.

Netherite ingots are crafting materials used to make netherite tools, weapons, and armor.

Netherite ingots can be used on a smithing table to upgrade diamond items to netherite items, as well as trim any armor piece. Data such as durability, enchantments, and custom names are preserved.

Trim color palette
The following color palettes are shown on the designs on trimmed armor:

 (a darker color palette is used when a netherite armor piece is trimmed using a netherite ingot).

Netherite ingots are the repair items for the netherite tier and armor material, and thus can be used to repair the following items in an anvil:

Netherite Helmet
Netherite Chestplate
Netherite Leggings
Netherite Boots
Netherite Sword
Netherite Pickaxe
Netherite Axe
Netherite Shovel
Netherite Hoe

A netherite ingot could be used to select powers from a beacon instead of using an emerald, gold ingot, iron ingot, or a diamond. The player must select one of the available powers, and then insert an ingot in the item slot. The gold option is more efficient than the netherite option because it consumes 3 fewer gold and no netherite scrap.
