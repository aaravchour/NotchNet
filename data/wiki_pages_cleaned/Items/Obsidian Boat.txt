The obsidian boat was a joke boat variant released in an April Fools' joke version.

Obsidian boats sank in water instead of floating. They also sank in lava like other boats but did not get destroyed in it.

Obsidian boats used the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events, although did not have any sounds of their own.

Obsidian boat is a joke feature and as such issues relating to them cannot be fixed.
