Prismarine crystals are items obtained by defeating guardians or elder guardians. They are used along with prismarine shards to craft sea lanterns.

Guardians and elder guardians have a 40% chance and 13 chance, respectively, of dropping prismarine crystals upon death. The maximum drop count is increased by one per level of Looting.

Prismarine crystals are dropped by sea lanterns when not using a Silk Touch tool. They drop 23 crystals each time, which can be increased to a maximum of 5 using the Fortune enchantment.
