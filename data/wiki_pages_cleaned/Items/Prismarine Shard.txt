A prismarine shard is an item obtained by defeating guardians or elder guardians. It can be used to craft various prismarine blocks as well as sea lanterns.

Prismarine shards are dropped upon the death of guardians and elder guardians. From these mobs, 02 shards are dropped each time. This can be increased to a maximum of 5 with the Looting enchantment.
