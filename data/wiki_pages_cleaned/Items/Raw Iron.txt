Raw iron is a raw metal resource obtained from mining iron ore.

Iron ore and deepslate iron ore mined using a stone pickaxe or better drops 1 unit of raw iron. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it can drop an extra unit per level of Fortune, allowing for a maximum of 4 with Fortune III. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops the ore block instead.

The primary usage of raw iron is smelting it into iron ingots.
