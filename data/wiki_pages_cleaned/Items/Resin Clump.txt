Resin Clumps are natural decorative blocks generated from a Creaking Heart, when a creaking is punched by a player. They are added in The Garden Awakens game drop.

Resin clumps are obtained via punching a naturally spawned creaking during the night. When this happens, its creaking heart will generate resin clumps onto neighbouring Pale oak logs. Breaking a creaking heart also drops resin clumps.
Resin clumps are occasionally found in Woodland Mansions in the form of loot.

Resin clumps can be used for decoration, like placing on stone to mimic custom ores, or underneath a bee nest to demonstrate honey drips. 

Resin clumps can be used to craft Resin Blocks.

Resin clumps can be smelted into resin bricks.

Resin Blocks appear bright, contrasting orange, similar to lava, but it is not animated. In fact, it appears slightly conglomerated with resin clumps tightly packed. Players may confuse resin blocks with baked beans, due to their unique cobbled texture.
