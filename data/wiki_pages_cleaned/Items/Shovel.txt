Shovels are tools used to hasten the process of breaking dirt, sand, gravel, and other soil blocks, as well as to convert dirt blocks into dirt paths.

Like other diamond tools, a diamond shovel can be upgraded to a netherite shovel, although increased durability and resistance to fire/lava in item form are the only benefits. The shovel's performance as a digging tool or a weapon is unchanged by the upgrade.
