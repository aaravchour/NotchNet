A slimeball is a crafting ingredient commonly dropped by slimes, and can be sneezed out by pandas.

If a slime's size is 1, it drops 02 slimeballs when killed. The maximum number of slimeballs is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 slimeballs with Looting III. When killed by a frog, they always drop 1 slimeball.

Baby pandas have a 1700 chance of dropping one slimeball when sneezing.

Wandering traders sometimes offer to sell a slimeball for 4 emeralds. They only trade 4 per Trader.

Slimeballs can be used to breed frogs and reduce the remaining growth duration of tadpoles by 10%. Both also follow a player holding a slimeball.

Note: This video is outdated, as slimeballs can now also be used to craft leads and slime blocks, breed frogs, and can now be obtained from baby pandas and wandering traders.
