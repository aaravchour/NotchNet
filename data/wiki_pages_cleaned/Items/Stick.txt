To craft each recipe once, a player would need 111 sticks, including 1 for the redstone torch in an activator rail, while using the extra tripwire hook for the crossbow. This would require 56 planks, or 14 logs, for the sticks, and an extra 29 planks for the wooden tools, tripwire hook, signs, fences, fence gate, grindstone, and slabs for the barrel. This means that the player needs a total of 85 planks, or 22 logs, plus 6 more for the campfire and soul campfire.
