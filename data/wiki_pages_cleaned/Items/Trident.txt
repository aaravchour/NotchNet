A trident is a weapon used in both melee and ranged combat and is a rare drop from drowned.

Tridents are not craftable. A trident can be obtained only when dropped by a drowned, or looted from trial chambers. Converted drowned are never equipped with tridents. 

6.25% (or 1 in 16) of Drowned in Java Edition spawn with a trident of random durability as their natural weapon. They have an 8.5% chance to drop their trident when killed by a player. The chance is increased by 1% for each level of Looting up to a max of 11.5% with Looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident from any given drowned is 0.53125% (about 1 in 188) or 0.71875% (about 1 in 140) with looting III.
In Java Edition, a trident held by a drowned has a chance to be enchanted, but the trident's enchantments have no effects for drowned.

Only 15% (or 3 in 20) of Drowned in Bedrock Edition spawn with tridents. Of these, they have a 25% chance to drop their trident when killed by a player. This chance is increased by 4% for each level of looting up to a max of 37% with looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident from any given drowned is 3.75% (or 3 in 80) or 5.55% with looting III.

Tridents thrown onto the ground by a player can be picked up; however, tridents thrown by drowned cannot be picked up, similar to arrows shot by skeletons, strays, and pillagers. When a trident is thrown in creative mode, only its owner can pick it up. Other players in creative mode also cannot pick up said trident.

Drowned who are holding tridents will sometimes drop their trident at full durability if given a nautilus shell.

15% of drowned in Bedrock Edition, and 6.25% in Java Edition, spawn with a trident as its natural weapon. It throws the trident at its opponent every 1.5 seconds, dealing 9 damage in normal difficulty. A drowned can throw unlimited tridents, and these tridents cannot be picked up by the player.
A villager can be turned into a zombie villager if it is killed by a trident thrown by a drowned: the chance of conversion is 0% on Easy difficulty, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard and Hardcore.
In Bedrock Edition, a drowned can use the trident's melee attack if its target is within three blocks. The melee attack deals 9 damage.

Pressing attack while holding a trident deals damage to both mobs and players. Tridents deal 9 melee damage. A successful hit consumes durability of the trident.

 
Pressing and holding use while holding a trident charges it. When released at half charge or more, the trident is thrown and deals damage to any entity it hits. Note that it doesn't have to be full charge for the complete damage and length. It flies on a ballistic trajectory similar to that of an arrow, but at 80% strength. If the trident hits a block, it sticks to the block. If it hits an entity, it bounces off the entity and lands nearby. It is also blocked by shields and can be retrieved once it lands in the ground. Thrown tridents can trigger wooden buttons, wooden pressure plates, and target blocks. A trident can be thrown at a chorus flower or pointed dripstone to break it, which causes the block to be dropped as its respective item.
In Bedrock Edition and Java Edition Combat Test 4, tridents can be shot by dispensers regardless of enchantment.
Tridents enchanted with Loyalty return to the thrower after hitting an entity/hitting and bouncing off an entity then hitting a block or just a block. A Loyalty-enchanted trident fired from a dispenser just sticks to the block it strikes. Higher levels of enchantment result in shorter recovery times. In Java Edition, throwing a trident enchanted with Loyalty into the void destroys it, while in Bedrock Edition it automatically returns to the player. Tridents (if enchanted with Loyalty), can take fire damage but still return to the player if thrown in lava. This is especially helpful in the Nether should the player be using a trident instead of a bow. If a trident enchanted with Loyalty attempts to return to a player with no available inventory space, the trident floats near the player until inventory space becomes available.
Thrown tridents take 1 durability damage, regardless of whether it hit an entity or not. Tridents with 1 durability remaining cannot be thrown.
Tridents enchanted with Riptide launch the player a certain distance when thrown, with the distance increasing for higher enchantment levels. They can be thrown only if the player is standing in water, or if it is raining on the block they are standing on. If the player charges it but walks into a nearby dry area, the charge is canceled. If the player throws a Riptide trident and collides with a mob, the mob takes melee damage (including critical damage if the player is falling). In Java Edition tridents enchanted with Riptide take one durability damage upon throwing, and lose an additional 1 durability if it collides with an entity on both editions. Each level of Riptide increases the distance traveled by six blocks. The enchantment at level one launches the player nine blocks, fifteen blocks at level two, and twenty-one blocks at level three.
Tridents enchanted with Channeling summon a lightning bolt if there is a thunderstorm, although only upon hitting a mob or player standing in the rain as well as a lightning rod placed in the rain.
Unlike other projectiles, the trident does not slow down when thrown through water or lava.
In Java Edition, the Impaling enchantment affects all water mobs. In Bedrock Edition, it deals extra damage to players and mobs in water or rain.
Unlike arrows, thrown tridents do not despawn. Tridents despawn after 60 seconds if they are not picked up.

Magical damage
Using Riptide, nearby players or mobs are dealt splash damage within an 8.258.254.25 cubical area. It stacks with the Impaling enchantment and Strength effect. Critical hits do not increase splash damage, but affect the target. 
In Bedrock Edition, thrown tridents can damage the ender dragon while resting on the bedrock fountain. In Java Edition, they act just like arrows  deflected, but burn as if they had Flame.

Thrown tridents and splashes deal 8 damage. The damage remains the same regardless of the trident's speed. It has a faster charging speed than a bow or crossbow (barring the Quick Charge enchantment.)

In Java Edition, tridents have an attack speed of 1.1 and take ~0.91 seconds to recover.

In Bedrock Edition, tridents have no attack cooldown and do the following damage:

A trident with the Riptide enchantment can be used to propel a player with a pair of elytra, but only in rainy weather, during snowy weather in certain biomes or while the player is in a body of water. A Riptide trident can boost the player to speeds as high as 125 blocks per second, much faster than the 33.5 blocks-per-second speed achievable using firework rockets.

In Java Edition, the Impaling enchantment deals extra damage to all water mobs. In Bedrock Edition and in Java Edition Combat Test 3, it deals extra damage to all players and mobs in water or rain.

Tridents have a base enchantability of 1 and can receive the following enchantments:

Notes

Tridents have the same durability as an iron sword. Whenever a trident deals damage, its durability decreases by 1.
Tridents can be repaired by:

combining two damaged tridents in a grindstone, or on a crafting table or the 22 inventory grid, which removes any enchantments except for Curse of Vanishing and Curse of Binding
combining a damaged trident with another trident on an anvil, which preserves enchantments.
applying the Mending enchantment.

Java Edition:
Thrown tridents use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Issues relating to "Trident" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

If a player throws a Loyalty-enchanted trident and the player's inventory subsequently fills, the trident hovers around or through the player's skin until an inventory slot opens, which it fills immediately. Multiple tridents can be 'queued' to re-enter the player's inventory in this manner.
In Java Edition in Creative mode, sword enchantments can be applied to tridents. This includes Sharpness, Fire Aspect, and Looting. Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods increases their damage against their specific mobs, as well.
Thrown tridents pass through nether portal blocks without being transported to the Nether or the Overworld.
Using a trident enchanted with Riptide while riding an entity cancels the charge and does nothing.
