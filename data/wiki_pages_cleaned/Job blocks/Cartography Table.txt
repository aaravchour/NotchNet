A cartography table is a utility block used for cloning, zooming out, and locking maps. It also serves as a cartographer's job site block.

A cartography table can be obtained using any tool or by hand, although an axe is fastest.

Cartography tables can generate naturally inside cartographer houses in villages.

Cartography tables are used for zooming out, cloning, and locking maps (making them unable to be altered). They can also be used for adding pointers to maps, creating empty maps, and renaming maps.
Below is a list of brief descriptions of all available functions of the cartography table:
For more detailed information of each of these function, see Map  Usage.

Zooming out a map always starts with an existing map, not a blank map. Zooming it out makes the map aligned to the grid that would include the area of the original map. To build a set of maps such as for a map wall, a player cannot create several level 0 (base) maps at one location then zoom them out before going out into the world to fill them in; the player must start with a base map created in each area to be covered by the zoomed out map. See more discussion of map alignment at Map.

If a village has a cartography table that has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby villager who hasn't chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to a cartographer.

A cartography table can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

Cartography tables can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
