minecraft:dupe_hack is a joke item from Java Edition 23w13a_or_b.

Once the dupe_hack_occurrence_chance vote is approved the dupe hack item has a random chance of dropping whenever an entity with chests is killed by a player, e.g. when destroying a minecart with chest with a sword.
It doesn't appear in the Creative menu, not even when the option "Operator Items Tab" is enabled, but can be given to the player with /give and other commands.

The dupe hack item can be used to create a limited amount of duplicate items by placing it on a crafting table with any other item. It has a random chance of breaking, controlled by the dupe_hack_break_chance vote. This limitation can be mostly bypassed by putting the items in an ender chest first and duplicating the chest.
When using the dupe hack, it has a random chance of breaking, which is often decided by votes.
