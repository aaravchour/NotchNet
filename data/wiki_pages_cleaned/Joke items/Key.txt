Keys were a joke item from Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34.
There are three different keys: red, yellow, and blue.

The red key was dropped by the wither, the yellow key was dropped by ravagers, and the blue key was dropped by the elder guardian.

These keys were also obtainable by using the cheat code "IDKFA" when typing in chat.

 A key with a similar appearance is present in The Europa Arcology Incident, a game made by Notch in 2009.
Likely a reference to doom (1993) which also had similarly colored keys, and a shareware version.
