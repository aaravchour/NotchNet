The block of bamboo is a log-like block made of bamboo.
A block of stripped bamboo is an alternate variant made by using an axe on a block of bamboo.

They can be broken by hand, but using an axe speeds up the process.

Using an axe on a block of bamboo turns it into a block of stripped bamboo.

They can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block. As fuel, it is more efficient to use bamboo planks rather than using block of bamboo. 2 bamboo planks can smelt 3 items, but a block of bamboo can only smelt 1.5 items and 9 harvested bamboo smelts 2.25 items.
Unlike logs, blocks of bamboo cannot be smelted into charcoal.

Block of bamboo can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
