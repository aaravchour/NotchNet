Bricks are a decorative building block.

Bricks naturally generate in underwater ruins, and in plains village armorer houses. They can also spawn in trail ruins.

Bricks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

Bricks have the same blast resistance as other stone-based blocks, so they can be used as a durable building block.

Bricks can be placed under note blocks to produce bass drum sounds.
