The Heat Block is a block that can melt snow and ice like a torch, but does not give off light.

Heat blocks melt snow layers and ice within 2 blocks (taxicab distance). It is unique in that it is the only block that melts objects without giving off light.

Iron corrodes in salt water way faster than it does in water, because electrochemistry is involved.
The ingredients of the heat block corresponds to the contents of hand warmers. A hand warmer generates heat due to the same electrochemistry that rusts iron in seawater, but with powdered iron the effect becomes more appreciable.
