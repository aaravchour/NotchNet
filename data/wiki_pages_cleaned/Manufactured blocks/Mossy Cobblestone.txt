Mossy cobblestone is a variant of cobblestone with green moss on it. It is mainly used for crafting or as building block.

Mossy cobblestone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining is slower and it drops nothing.

Mossy cobblestone occurs naturally in dungeons, jungle temples, pillager outposts, underwater ruins, and plains, taiga, snowy taiga, and zombie villages. It can also be found in the form of forest rocks in the old growth taiga biome.

Mossy cobblestone can be used as a basic building block, as it is blast resistant and fairly common.

Mossy cobblestone can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
