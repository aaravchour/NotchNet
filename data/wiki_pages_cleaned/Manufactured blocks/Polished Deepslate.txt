Polished deepslate is the stone-like polished version of deepslate.

Polished deepslate generate naturally in ancient cities.

Polished deepslate can be obtained only by mining it with a pickaxe. When mined using any other tool, it drops nothing.

Using a stonecutter instead of a crafting table can produce all the derivative deepslate blocks directly. All of the blocks below, including polished deepslate, can also be obtained directly from cobbled deepslate.
