A smithing table is a utility block used to alter tools and armor at the cost of a smithing template and the appropriate material, a process that keeps all enchantments. This is the only way to obtain trimmed armor or upgrade diamond equipment with netherite. It also serves as a toolsmith's job site block.

Smithing tables can be obtained from a village or crafting.

Smithing tables can spawn naturally inside toolsmith houses in villages. They can also spawn in trail ruins.

Smithing tables can be broken using any tool or by hand, but an axe is fastest.

While upgrading, the newly crafted netherite gear retains the enchantments, prior work penalty and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond gear.
Upgrading gear does not remove incompatible enchantments, such as multiple different Protection enchantments.
Unlike anvils, using a smithing table to upgrade diamond gear to netherite gear costs no experience and does not increase the prior work penalty.
Smithing table recipes use the data pack system.

If a village contains a smithing table that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who hasn't already chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to toolsmith. If a villager with this profession has already been traded with, it cannot change jobs.

Trimming requires an armor piece, a smithing template and the mineral/crystal for the color the player desires (listed below).

Amethyst Shard
Copper Ingot
Diamond
Emerald
Gold Ingot
Iron Ingot
Lapis Lazuli
Nether Quartz
Netherite Ingot
Redstone Dust
Resin Brick
After trimming, the armor will have the pattern according to the smithing templates. The color of the pattern is determined by the materials color.

Smithing tables can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

Smithing tables can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
