The Place Block is a joke block, unlocked by a vote, that takes other blocks from a container on its back side and places them in front of it when given a redstone signal.

A Place Block can be mined with a pickaxe, in which case it drops only itself as it has no storage capacity on its own. If mined without a pickaxe, the block breaks but drops no item.

As part of Java Edition 23w13a_or_b the Place Block can only be "used" when the vote for minecraft:place_block is approved. If this is not the case, the block cannot be:

placed (nothing happens)
dropped (the block gets removed from the inventory but no item appears)
activated (the block doesn't react to redstone signals)
crafted (the output of the crafting table stays empty)

A Place Block can be used to place any block from any container. This includes chests, hoppers, and dispensers. They can be used  When there is already a block in front of the output, the block that would have been placed is dropped as an item.
A Place Block can be placed so that its in- and outputs face in any direction, including up or down. When placed, the output faces toward the player. The texture of this side is identical to the output of an observer.

A Place Block can be activated by:

an adjacent active power component (Exceptions: a redstone torch does not turn ON a Place Block it is attached to)
an adjacent powered opaque block (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)
a powered redstone repeater or redstone comparator facing the Place Block
powered redstone dust configured to point at the Place Block, or on top of it, or a directionless "dot" next to it; a Place Block is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.
A Place Block is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.

Place blocks  are an unsupported item due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed.
