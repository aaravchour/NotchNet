A sculk shrieker is a sculk block found in the deep dark biome that produces a "shrieking" noise when a player either stands on it (regardless of sneaking) or triggers a nearby sculk sensor. Shriekers that generate naturally in the deep dark will inflict Darkness and may summon a warden when triggered, but those that are placed by a player or sculk catalyst will never summon wardens or inflict Darkness under any circumstance.

Sculk shriekers can be found infrequently within the deep dark biome, and they are much more common within ancient cities.

Sculk shriekers can be mined with any tool, but hoes are the quickest. It drops 5 experience when mined without Silk Touch. When a sculk shrieker is broken it loses the ability to summon the warden, even if mined with Silk Touch.

A sculk catalyst has a 1% chance of generating a sculk shrieker on top of a sculk block. These shriekers do not summon the warden.

Sculk shriekers "shriek" after being activated. A sculk shrieker activates when any player stands on the black part in the center of the block, even when sneaking. Sculk shriekers are also activated by any sculk sensor triggered within an 8-block spherical radius of itself, but only if the vibration was caused by a player. However, a sculk sensor cannot activate the sculk shrieker if the line between the two contains a wool block. The shrieker shrieks for exactly 90 game ticks (4.5 seconds). 

Sculk shriekers that naturally generate in the deep dark biome are capable of inflicting the Darkness effect upon players and summoning wardens. If a sculk shrieker is placed by a player or generated via a sculk catalyst, the tag can_summon is set to false, and therefore a warden cannot be summoned and Darkness cannot be inflicted by that sculk shrieker. Each time a naturally generated sculk shrieker is activated, it adds 1 to a "warning" level to alert the warden. The warning level is specific to each player, not each sculk shrieker, meaning that the same player can activate a different sculk shrieker for each of the four times, and a warden still spawns on the fourth activation, even though any particular shrieker had been activated once. If a player does not activate any sculk shrieker, the warning level decreases by 1 every 10 minutes (12000 ticks). After the shrieking ends, all players in Survival or Adventure mode within 40 blocks are given the Darkness effect for 12 seconds. After a warden is summoned, a player's warning level does not reset back to 0, meaning multiple wardens can be summoned.
Naturally generated sculk shriekers have a 10-second cooldown per player. This means that if a player triggers one shrieker, they are completely unable to trigger any other shrieker within 10 seconds. The cooldown period includes the 4.5-second shrieking, which means 5.5 seconds after the previous shrieking ends, the player can activate sculk shriekers again.
When a player's warning level reaches level 4, the sculk shrieker attempts to spawn a warden after its shrieking ends. Up to 20 attempts are made to spawn a warden within an 111311 box centered on the shrieker. If there isn't another warden within 24 blocks, a warden emerges from the ground. The warden always spawns at the highest available block. If the shrieker is broken before it ends shrieking, the warden spawns immediately as a result. If all 20 spawning attempts fail, a loud roaring sound is played.
In Java Edition, if the game rule doWardenSpawning is set to false, naturally generated sculk shriekers behave as if they are placed by a player: they do shriek, but there is no shrieking cooldown, the player's warning level does not increase, no Darkness effect is inflicted, and no warden spawns.
If the player that triggered the sculk shrieker is outside the shrieker's range when the shrieking ends, the sculk shrieker does not apply the Darkness effect to any player. The player's warning level still increases by 1.
It is possible to make a warden spawn from a distance, by shooting a projectile into the direction of known sensors that are near shriekers.
The warnings have unique subtitles at different levels of warning: 1) "Warden approaches." 2) "Warden advances." 3) "Warden draws close."

The sculk shrieker's design was inspired by the human larynx.
The old shrieker was a combination of the modern day shrieker and scrapped sculk jaw as it would both scream and show teeth
The sculk shrieker's shrieks are similar to the sound effects of Minecraft Dungeons soul-based artifacts, primarily being the harvester.
