A baby zombie is a hostile zombie variant that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

Baby zombies resemble normal zombies but are smaller and more agile. They can spawn riding a chicken. This variant is known as the chicken jockey. They can also ride on each other and become a mob with six small zombies riding on a chicken, a chicken jockey tower.
