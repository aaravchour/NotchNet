A chicken jockey tower is a rare mob that can be found within various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

Chicken jockey towers are composed of a chicken jockey with six baby zombies balanced upon each other, with five of them sitting, and the top one balancing standing upright.

Creeper Woods
Soggy Swamp (Summoned by the corrupted cauldron)
Pumpkin Pastures
Arch Haven
Cacti Canyon
Chicken jockey towers can also spawn when night falls, regardless of the mission, when at least one hero dies in multiplayer.

The behavior of a chicken jockey tower is similar to a normal chicken jockey but is somewhat slower in speed due to the weight of the baby zombies. When the chicken gets hit, this causes the baby zombies to scatter and attack the hero at once.

The Tower is an ancient chicken jockey tower that is encountered during ancient hunts with the minimum offering of the following runes:

The ancient resides within a Creeper Woods-themed arena and possesses, at minimum, the following enchantments:

In the game files, chicken jockey towers are referred to internally by the name ChickenJockey.

As seen with chicken jockey towers, chickens in Minecraft Dungeons seem to be physically stronger than their original counterparts, being capable of carrying more baby zombies.
A chicken jockey tower can be somewhat replicated within the original Minecraft game via baby piglins, who will sometimes stack on top of a baby hoglin.
However, using commands, it is possible to perfectly replicate the stack seen in Dungeons.
