A mossy skeleton is an undead skeleton variant that can be found within the jungle awakens DLC of Minecraft Dungeons. Mossy skeletons have three variants as well as a melee variant that can be found exclusively within the arcade edition.

Mossy skeletons have vines and moss covering the entirety of their body. Small patches of moss can be found surrounding their head, and vines entangled around their ribcage. They have smaller moss patches on their legs and arms and also emit a green cloud of poison from their ribcage. This poison can affect the hero from the arrows they shoot, which inflicts the poisoned effect upon a direct hit.

Mossy skeletons are hostile towards heroes and will shoot them on sight, just like their normal counterparts, with the difference being unable to poison the hero even with their arrows.

A melee mossy skeleton is a defensive mossy skeleton variant that can be found exclusively within the arcade edition of Minecraft Dungeons.

Melee mossy skeletons spawn wearing the scale mail and sometimes the reinforced mail helmet giving them increased defense. Unlike mossy skeletons though, they primarily use melee, utilizing swords and daggers instead of ranged.

Like its normal variant, they attack the hero when seen but instead of ranged, they walk to the hero and attack them via melee.
