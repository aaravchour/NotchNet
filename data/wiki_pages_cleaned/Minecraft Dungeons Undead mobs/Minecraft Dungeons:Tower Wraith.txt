A tower wraith is a hostile tower keeper wraith variant that can be found within the Tower of Minecraft Dungeons.

Tower wraiths have the appearance of partial floating skeletons whose mouth and eyes glow bright blue. They wear gilded cloaks, like tower guards, and a color-shifting robe that appears as black or pink.

Tower

Tower wraiths attack using soul fire or noxious gas, depending on the color of their robe.
They are unaffected by the smiting enchantment.
Tower wraiths have four different behaviors.

Mode change
Tower wraiths occasionally will spin in place, changing the color of their robe. 

Teleport
Tower wraiths teleport away when a target gets too close. Attacking or stunning a tower wraith while it is teleporting cancels the teleport, though the tower wraith remains invisible for a few seconds. 

Basic attack
Black tower wraiths summon an Ice Bouquet like regular wraiths, the only difference being that the overall area of the flames is greater.

Poison cloud attack
Pink tower wraiths summon noxious gas clouds on the hero. 

Tower wraiths has 300 HP in the code. On Default I, all mobs have 9.6% health and 12% damage of what is set in the code.
