A zombie is an undead hostile mob that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons. Zombies have three direct variants.

The appearance of a zombie in Minecraft Dungeons is different from that of the original game. They have a different shade of green and they look more polished.
Some zombies are slightly taller than normal zombies, and have more health and defense. The 1st variant wears a scale mail chestplate and a reinforced mail helmet, and holds a single dagger in a reverse grip. The 2nd variant is the stronger variant wears a helmet and chestplate made of reinforced mail, wields a normal sword, and does more damage than any other zombie.

Zombies can be summoned by a necromancer or mob spawner. Zombies also spawn when night falls, regardless of mission, when at least one hero dies in multiplayer.

Zombies wander around when they idle.

Basic attack

Zombies turn their heads to look at the hero once seen, before slowly approaching to attack.

Novelty Sleep
