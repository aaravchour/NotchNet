The zombified baby pig is an undead baby pig variant that was unlockable during the Spookier Fall and its select missions in Minecraft Dungeons.

The zombified baby pig is an undead baby pig as noted by its face having exposed bone and flesh. It also has a large chunk of exposed flesh and bones on its left side. Small exposed bones and flesh are seen on its tiny legs.

The zombified baby pig is seen walking away from the Ruined Nether Portal and toward the launchpad, preparing to enter the main section of the Camp in order to discover how it missed the pet parade as well as the terrifying truth behind the Spookier Fall. Upon coming across the hero Elaine as they were frantically sweeping their cackling broom against a target dummy, the zombified baby pig began to show admiration for them and their sturdy bubbling cauldron armor. The zombified baby pig, upon deciding to stick with Elaine, attempts to see a connection between the heros bravery and strength with the combined match of their phantom cape and phantom bow. In the midst of a battle, the zombified baby pig marvels at Elaines bravery and honor as they cut down foes with their gnarly skull scythe and elegant webbed bow. Elaines wondrous spooky gourdian armor causes the zombified baby pig to come to the realization that it did not matter that it missed the Pet Parade, as it relished proudly having been apart of the Spookier Fall.

Spookier Fall (12 daily trials)

The zombified baby pig is purely cosmetic and does not attack any mobs. Despite being zombified, it does not transform into a zombified piglin and it is the first passive undead mob in Minecraft Dungeons.
