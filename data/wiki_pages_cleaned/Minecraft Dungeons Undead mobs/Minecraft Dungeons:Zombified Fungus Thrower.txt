A zombified fungus thrower is an undead fungus thrower variant found within the Flames of the Nether DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

Zombified fungus throwers possess blue armbands, purple headbands, and leather bags containing blue nethershrooms. Unlike living fungus throwers, however, their leather bag has a small rip running alongside it.

Zombified fungus throwers are identical to their non-zombified counterparts, able to throw two fungi that explode, leaving behind a poisoning cloud, and then stay a distance, then throw again, except they are slower and deal slightly more damage (Unconfirmed).

In the game files, zombified fungus throwers are referred to internally by the name ZombifiedPiglinFungusThrower.
