The arctic fox is a pet mob in Minecraft Dungeons, unlockable with the Creeping Winter DLC.

The arctic fox looks almost the same as an orange fox except it is white and blue, having bluish eyes and fur on its paws and tail.

The arctic fox is purely cosmetic and does not attack enemies. The arctic fox will occasionally whimper when stuck or when it takes fall damage and will run up to dropped items. Though it will react to falling, it does not take damage. It can be used to activate the redstone golem's mines.

An arctic fox appears in a Tweet from Minecraft Dungeons running in circles, chasing its tail. At the same time, the arctic fox somehow is able to avoid being trampled by the legions of Illagers rushing past it.
