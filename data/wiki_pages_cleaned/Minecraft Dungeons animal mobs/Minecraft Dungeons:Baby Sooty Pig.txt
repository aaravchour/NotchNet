The baby sooty pig is a cosmetic pet mob that can be unlocked as a reward in the Fauna Faire seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons.

The baby sooty pig is a juvenile version of the Sooty Pig. It is coal-black, with a pale pink strip across its back. It has some notable differences from its adult and base counterpart as it has flappier ears and a lighter brown nose.
