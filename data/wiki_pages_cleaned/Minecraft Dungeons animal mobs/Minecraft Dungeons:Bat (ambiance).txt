A bat is a non-attackable mob in Minecraft Dungeons that spawn in some missions for decoration.

Bats in Minecraft Dungeons look similar to their appearance in the main Minecraft game with the difference of having lighter brown fur and dark areas on their belly and neck. They also have a smaller mouth.
