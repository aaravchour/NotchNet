A cave spider is a poisonous spider variant that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

Cave spiders in Minecraft Dungeons are similar to cave spiders in the main Minecraft game with the only difference being the color, with the Minecraft Dungeons mob having a brighter and somewhat saturated color.
