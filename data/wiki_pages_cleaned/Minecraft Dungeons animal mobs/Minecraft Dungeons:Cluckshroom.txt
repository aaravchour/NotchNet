The cluckshroom is a cosmetic pet mob that can be unlocked as a reward in the Fauna Faire seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons.

The cluckshroom is a chicken variant covered in red feathers, white spots, and sprouting mushrooms on it, like in Minecraft Earth. It sports some unique differences though as it appears smaller, like a baby variant, and has two mushrooms on its body than multiple.

The cluckshroom follows heroes around. It is purely cosmetic and does not attack any mobs.
