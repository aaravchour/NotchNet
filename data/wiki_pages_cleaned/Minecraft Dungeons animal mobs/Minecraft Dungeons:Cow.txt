A cow is a passive animal that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

Cows in Minecraft Dungeons look the same as they do within the original Minecraft game.

Camp (Cinematic)
Creeper Woods
Creepy Crypt (Outside)
Pumpkin Pastures
Cacti Canyon (Canyon)
Lone Fortress (Secret area)

Cows walk around aimlessly, just like sheep, often seen eating grass.

In the game files, the basic and strong attack files of mooshooms are listed under the cow behavior file.
