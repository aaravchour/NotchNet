A dolphin is a neutral mob that can be found within the Hidden Depths DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

Coral Rise
Abyssal Monument
Radiant Ravine

Dolphins normally just swim around aimlessly, unless it is attacked where it will bite the hero and attract any nearby Dolphins nearby to bite and charge the hero. They can also grant Dolphin's Grace to the hero when near. If attacked by another mob, they also retaliate and attack that mob.
