The endermite is a cosmetic pet in Minecraft Dungeons obtained through the Echoing Void DLC. It is purely cosmetic and does not attack enemies.

The endermite resembles its hostile counterpart with the exception that it's passive and possesses a blue eye instead of a red eye. It also emits blue particles instead of purple ones.
