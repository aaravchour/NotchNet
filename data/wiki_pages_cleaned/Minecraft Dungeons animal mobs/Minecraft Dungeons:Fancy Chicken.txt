The fancy chicken is a cosmetic pet mob that can be unlocked as a reward in the Fauna Faire seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons.

The fancy chicken resembles its original game variant, possessing the same multicolored feathers which make it resemble the typical rooster. The only differences however is that it appears smaller, like a baby variant, and has shorter legs.

The fancy chicken follows heroes around. It is purely cosmetic and does not attack any mobs.
