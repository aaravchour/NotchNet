The fox is a pet mob that is obtainable within the Cloudy Climb seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons. It has a variant that was added previously within the Creeping Winter DLC. The fox also makes an appearance in the Arcade spin-off as a summonable mob. It was originally seen in the Cross Platform Play Trailer, long before it was officially added.

Foxes overall appear similar to their counterparts in the main Minecraft game, having orange fur, black ears, long snouts, and a bushy tail ending in white fur.

In the main section of the Camp, the fox was being adored alongside the spotted baby pig. Sometime presumably later, a hero in wolf armor tried to entertain the fox with a theatrical backflip somewhere in the Mainland. However, the fox was not interested in the hero's theatrics.

The fox follows the hero. It cannot do anything except for a few actions, such as triggering pressure plates.
In the Arcade spin-off, the fox attacks mobs by biting them, as well as following the hero.

In the game files, the fox is referred to internally by the name Fox.
