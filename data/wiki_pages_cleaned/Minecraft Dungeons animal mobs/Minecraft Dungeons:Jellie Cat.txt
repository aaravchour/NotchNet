The Jellie cat is an unused mob that appears within the Minecraft Dungeons Cross-Platform Play Trailer, where two Jellie cats are seen near Dani, with one on her seat behind her and one beside her. A third Jellie cat is seen by the fish tank looking at the fish. It only appears in trailers, never getting added in the game itself.

The Jellie cat is a variant of the cat with gray patches of fur covering up to its tail and covering its face. It also has gray paws on its rear end. It has bluish eyes.

The Jellie cat is the only mob seen in trailers that has no correlation to the game itself, even in files.
