A mooshroom is a hostile cow variant that can be found within the secret ??? mission of Minecraft Dungeons.

Mooshrooms look exactly as they do within the original Minecraft game, with a red body that has white spots in it. They have horns at the sides of their heads, and black eyes. The only difference, however, is that the red mushrooms and horns on their back and head are a 3D model, rather than a 2D model within the original game.
