An ocelot is a passive animal that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

The spots on their body are slightly darker than they are in the original game.

Dingy Jungle
Panda Plateau
Overgrown Temple
Broken Citadel (Cinematic)
Treetop Tangle
Ocelots can spawn enchanted, but are still harmless except when enchanted with Fire Trail or Electrified.

Ocelots roam the area, walking and sitting around. Creepers will flee from ocelots and do not explode when an ocelot is nearby.

Basic attack
Ocelots often attack creepers that get too close to them, unlike within the original game.
