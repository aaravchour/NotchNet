A pig is a passive animal that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

A pig's appearance is the same as its texture from the original game. They also use the same sounds aside from a unique knee shake sound.

They also spawn within other missions usually outside of the hero's view to fit the ambience.

Pigs, unlike other mobs, do not seem to interact with heroes and cannot be attacked in the base game. In Creeping Winter DLC, they are attackable. However, even then, the only way to damage them is by using the Shockwave enchantment or a weapon with a high area such as a Double Axe. They are affected by the Chilling enchantment.
In Minecraft Dungeons Arcade, they are capable of attacking mobs via headbutting and they follow the hero.

In the Minecraft Dungeons Arcade game, it is one of the many obtainable pets and an exclusive pet there.
