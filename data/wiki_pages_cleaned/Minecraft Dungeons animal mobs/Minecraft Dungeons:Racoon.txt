The racoon is a cosmetic pet mob that can be unlocked as a reward in the Fauna Faire seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons.

The racoon is a small mob similar in shape and model to the red panda except that it has grey fur, black eye spots and nose, and white atches all throughout its body. It also has its signature black striped tail.
