A turtle is a passive animal that can be found within the hidden depths DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

A turtle overall resembles its appearance within the original game, with the only difference being that its texture is brighter and there are bright green stripes along its shell, similar to loggerhead and green sea turtles from the real world.

Turtles tend to swim around aimlessly. Unlike base game turtles, they have a unique idle behavior where they lie on their shells and float motionless, like relaxing. They are also capable of doing a flip, as seen in the caged turtles within the radiant ravine. Within the radiant ravine, turtles act as non-attackable mobs needing to be rescued.
