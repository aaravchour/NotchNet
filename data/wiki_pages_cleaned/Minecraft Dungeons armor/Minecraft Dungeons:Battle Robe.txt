+X health

Battle robes provides 30% increased attack damage rather than 15% increased speed. It's best used with Cool Down to provide a total of -45.25% artifact cooldown time. It also works well with the Death Cap Mushroom since it boosts melee speed and movement speed, and battle robes make it recharge quicker, and allows more damage in tandem with the mushroom.
