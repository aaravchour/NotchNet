The gilded glory is a unique emerald gear variant that can be found within the howling peaks DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

The Gilded Glory looks like its common variant apart from much having more emeralds over a dark blue cloak. It also appears to be inlaid with a small amount of gold, hence its name.
