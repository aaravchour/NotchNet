In the patch notes, the spooky gourdian is listed as the Soul Jack-O-Lantern armor set alongside the cackling broom and the phantom bow.
Sometimes, its stats would change where it would sometimes get a weapon damage boost but in-game, it is a retexture of the wither armor.
When worn, a trail of blue embers follow the hero behind, which could possibly be soul fire.
