The love medallion flies around quickly when used, and three mobs give off hearts. These mobs become allies for ten seconds, after that they disappear. Mobs that become allies become affected by any properties that affect allies, as well as the Beast Boss, Beast Burst, and Beast Surge enchantments.
Certain mobs are effected differently if they have a different type of attack. Hoglins still try to attack the hero but cannot damage or knockback the hero. Magma Cubes follow the hero and do not target non ally mobs. Status-inflicting area mobs such as blazes, fungus throwers, and zombified fungus thrower no longer damage the hero and damage other mobs.
