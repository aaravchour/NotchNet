The totem of casting uses seventy souls to create a large aura, after a short time an effect occurs where any hero standing in this aura has the cooldown of their artifacts reduced. However, in practice the cooldown is completely reset instead of just reduced. The range and size of this aura increases with the power level of the artifact.
