The giant cave spider  is a large cave spider boss variant that can be found within the cacti canyon of the arcade edition of Minecraft Dungeons.

The giant cave spider is a large cave spider that has been enhanced by the Arch-Illager using the Orb of Dominance, causing its body to emit crackling purple energy. Unlike normal cave spiders, the giant cave spider can fling webs at heroes.

The giant cave spider is a fast boss with strong attacks and quick maneuvers as a way to avoid attacks. What makes this boss hard is due to the many spiders and cave spiders that surround the hero in the arena. The giant cave spider has three different attacks:

Basic attack
The giant cave spider flings a single web at any target within sight.

Bite
The giant cave spider attempts to bite a nearby target, dealing damage.

Charge attack
The giant cave spider charges at a target from a distance, attempting to knock them back, and damaging any mobs in the way.
