Cooked salmon is a consumable that can be found within the creeping winter DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

Cooked salmon most likely comes from the unused Salmon, which was planned for Hidden Depths. However, the Creeping Winter was developed long before it. It appears similar to salmon from the original game, with a red body, grayish-cyan head, light red fins and mouth of the same color as the fins.
