A shadow brew is a potion that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

Shadow brews are obtainable by defeating mobs, and opening chests.
The surprise gift armor enchantment and the looting weapon enchantment also have a chance to create the potion, as well as other consumables.
The shadow shot weapon enchantment (Only obtainable by the shadow crossbow and the veiled crossbow) gives the shadow brew effect, as well as the shadow shifter and the satchel of elixirs, which all gives the same effect. 
Witches often throw potions identical to shadow brews. However, these potions create a purple cloud that does continuous damage more like the poison cloud enchantment than actual shadow brews.

Shadow brews grant the hero invisibility and increased damage on the next melee attack when consumed, which are combined into the shadow form effect. Shadow form lasts for ten seconds and ends after hitting an enemy or when the duration runs out.

The shadow form is an effect that can be found exclusively by consuming shadow brews within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

The shadow form grants invisibility, which causes nearby mobs to not be aggressive towards the hero, and also makes the hero transparent, while leaving armor and weapons fully visible. Taking off equipment beforehand has no additional benefit.
Next attack does increased damage.
If an attack does 100 damage, with Shadow Form it deals 800. New Damage = Base Damage 100 + (Base Damage 100 * 7, 700, from Shadow Form) = 800 
If the buff Strength from Strength Potion is active as well, the result is 900. New Damage = Base Damage 100 + (Base Damage 100 * 7, 700, from Shadow Form) + (Base Damage 100, from Strength) = 900

In the game files, shadow brews are referred to by the name BackstabbersBrew.
