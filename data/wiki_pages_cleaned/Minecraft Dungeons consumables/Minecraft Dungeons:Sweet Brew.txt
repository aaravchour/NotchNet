A sweet brew is a consumable potion that can be found within the creeping winter DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

Sweet brews can be obtained by defeating mobs and opening chests.

Sweet brews give the hero a small defense boost and Freezing Resistance for 120 seconds, during which, the hero is unaffected by the Frozen effect, and the damage taken by the hero is reduced by about 1/6.
