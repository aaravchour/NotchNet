The baby goat is a cosmetic pet mob that can be found within the howling peaks DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

The baby goat is a juvenile goat. Unlike baby goats within the original game, they have a unique model and body shape, where they are incredibly small and possess a smaller head and body, as well as small horns.
