The baby turtle is a juvenile turtle. Unlike the original game, it is a bit bigger in size, almost the size of a hero's head.

The baby turtle is purely cosmetic and does not attack any mobs. 

A tweet on the dungeons Twitter attempts to connect the relationship between turtle armor and the baby turtle.
The baby turtle appears in a tweet from Minecraft Dungeons, encouraging heroes to bring the pet to the hidden depths missions.
The baby turtle can seemingly float in the air instead of swim when in a land-based mission. This is probably some unfixed or intentional feature with the pet.
Despite this, the baby turtle is seen crawling in a Twitter video, hiding in its shell on the ground to avoid being trampled by a zombie horde.
