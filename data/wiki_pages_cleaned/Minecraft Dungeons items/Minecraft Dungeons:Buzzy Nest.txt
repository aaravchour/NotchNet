A bee is a summonable mob that gets summoned as part of a swarm when the buzzy nest is placed, when a hero wears beenest armor/beehive armor, or any weapon or armor enchanted with tumblebee or busy bee found in Minecraft Dungeons.

Bees appear the same as their Minecraft counterpart, with large eyes, quickly flapping wings, and six legs.

Broken Citadel (Cinematic)

Unlike their Minecraft counterparts, they can sting up to three times before dying. Alternatively, they may last up to thirty seconds. Upon death, bees fade into yellow smoke.
Upon being summoned, they attack nearby hostile mobs with their stingers.
