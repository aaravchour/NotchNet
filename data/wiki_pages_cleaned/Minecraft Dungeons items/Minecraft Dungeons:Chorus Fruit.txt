A chorus fruit is a consumable that can be found within the echoing void DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

When consumed, chorus fruit heals 30% of the hero's health in one second. Unlike the original game, it does not teleport the hero away when eaten.

In the game files, chorus fruit is referred to internally by the name Food8.
