An entangle vine is a non-attackable entity that can be summoned by the corrupted seeds, whisperers, wavewhisperers, and the treetop whisperer within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

When a hero uses the corrupted seeds, it will summon a small patch of entangle vines which can trap mobs and other heroes for a few seconds before disappearing. Entangle vines are also summoned when a whisperer or a wavewhisperer stretches their arms forward and closes their palms.

In the game files, the corrupted seeds are referred to internally by the names CorruptedSeeds, and the Corrupted-Seeds.
