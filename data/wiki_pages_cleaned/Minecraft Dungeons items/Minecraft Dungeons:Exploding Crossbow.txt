Exploding crossbows possess very high power, very low speed, and a very small ammo supply. The quiver starts with 20 arrows, normal arrow bundles give 10 arrows, supply chest bundles give another 20 arrows, and surprise gift bundles give 5 arrows. The exploding crossbow is a little smaller than most crossbows.
Damage caused by the arrows can be increased with enchantments, the Strength buff, and certain armor have ranged damage increases, such as hunter's armor. Also, it is the only ranged weapon in the game that is unaffected by the Deflect enchantment.
