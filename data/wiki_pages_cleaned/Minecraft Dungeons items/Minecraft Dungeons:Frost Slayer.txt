The frost slayer is a unique claymore variant that can be found within the various seasonal trials of Minecraft Dungeons. It behaves identically to the broadsword.

The frost slayer is a large blue and white claymore, with an ice-like and wintery look. It features ice spiking out of the bottom half of the blade, the cross-guard, and underneath the dark blue/navy colored handle. The top half of the blade is uniform and symmetrical.
