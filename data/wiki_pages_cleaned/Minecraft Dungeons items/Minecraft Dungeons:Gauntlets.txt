Gauntlets possess low power, high speed, and low area, and have a combo consisting of four alternating punches, a left hook, an uppercut, and a lunge punch. The first five hits deal the weapon's minimum melee damage, the uppercut does around 40% more damage, and the lunge punch deals the maximum melee damage.
