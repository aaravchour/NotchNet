The harvester has a four second cooldown, +1 soul gathering, requires forty souls to activate, and deals soul damage. Upon activating, the harvester creates a circle that damages mobs within it with a high-energy blast, dropping any loot. Mobs defeated by the harvester do not drop souls. The harvester does the same amount of damage to all mobs within the blast radius.
The damage dealt by the harvester is increased by any gear with a property that increases artifact damage, such as the cave crawler, as well as the Soul Focus enchantment.
