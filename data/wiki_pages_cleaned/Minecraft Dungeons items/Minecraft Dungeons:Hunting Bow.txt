A hunting bow is a ranged weapon that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons. Its unique variants are the master's bow, the hunter's promise, and the ancient bow.

The Hunter's Bow is a tall maroon bow with a grey handle and white string. It is very similar in look to the Power Bow aside from the colour, however the two are completely separate items.

Hunting bows use two internal, hidden enchantments.
