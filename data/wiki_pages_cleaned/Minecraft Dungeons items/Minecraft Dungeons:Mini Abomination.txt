The mini abomination is a cosmetic pet ministrosity that can be unlocked as a reward in the Luminous Night seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons.

The mini abomination appears to be a tiny variant of the jungle abomination, looking somewhat like a stump with arms, legs, and a glowing pink mouth and eyes. It also has a green leaf on it's right arm and a pink flower on the top of it's head.
