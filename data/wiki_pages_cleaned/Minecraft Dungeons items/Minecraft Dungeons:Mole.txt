The mole is a cosmetic pet mob that can be unlocked as a reward in the Luminous Night seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons.

The mole is a small burrowing mob that resembles real-life moles, having a small body and brown fur, a lack of eyes, a large snout, and large digging claws which it uses to scooch around to follow the player.
