A mountaineer axe is an axe variant that can be found exclusively equipped by mountaineers and the rampart captain within the howling peaks DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

Mountaineer axes cannot be obtained. Adding this item to the inventory with an inventory editor will crash the game when clicked on.

Mountaineer axes utilize the sound effects of normal axes.
Mountaineer axes look like ice axes, which are tools used by climbers to traverse ice or other slippery objects.
They are often referred to as picks due to their appearance despite the ID saying that they are an axe variant, similar to ladles.
