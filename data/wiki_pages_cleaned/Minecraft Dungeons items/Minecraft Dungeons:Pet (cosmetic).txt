The term Cosmetic pet refers to the cosmetic mobs that provide no functional benefits to the hero. All available cosmetics are obtainable only by the purchasing of DLC packs and equipable from the cosmetics page  of the inventory. 

Cosmetic pets are non-attackable mobs that move alongside the hero, teleporting when too far, and ignores other mobs. Pets, like other mobs, are able to activate the pressure plates of traps in the environment, such as those in Desert Temple, and have a very rare chance to drop consumables, armor, and weapons upon falling off the map. These are not to be confused with Summons that can interact with mobs.

In the game files, all cosmetic pets are located internally under the name Friendlies.
