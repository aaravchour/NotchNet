The raven is a pet mob revealed at Minecraft Live 2021, and added as a reward in the Cloudy Climb seasonal adventure in Minecraft Dungeons. 

The raven is a small bird mob possessing black iridescent plumage and jagged tail feathers and wings. It also has a slightly purplish beak and eyes.

The raven can be obtained as a reward in the Cloudy Climb for the Tower, however it is only obtainable with the paid Adventure Pass.

The raven is purely cosmetic and does not attack enemies.

Fly
When raven flies, it sometimes drops some feathers.

It is one of two brand new and unique bird mobs to be added in Dungeons, the other being the Toucan.
