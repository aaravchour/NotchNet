The spotted baby pig is a cosmetic baby pig variant that can be unlocked as a reward in the Cloudy Climb seasonal adventure of Minecraft Dungeons.

The spotted baby pig resembles Minecraft Earth's spotted pig, with the only difference being that the spotted baby pig has more pinkish skin and having brown spots on its body instead of black.
