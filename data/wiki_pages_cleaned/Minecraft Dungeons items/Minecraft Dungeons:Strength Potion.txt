A strength potion is a consumable potion that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

The Strength potion is mainly obtained by defeating mobs, and opening chests.
The common Surprise Gift armor enchantment and the common Looting weapon enchantment also have a chance to create the potion, as well as other consumables.

Strength potions grant the hero increased damage from the Strength effect, which lasts for thirty seconds and ends when the duration runs out.

The Strength status effect causes attacks to deal additional damage.
If an attack does 100 damage, with Strength it deals 200. New Damage = Base Damage 100 + (Base Damage 100 *1, 100, from Strength) = 200
If the Shadow Form effect from shadow brews is active as well, the result is 900. New Damage = Base Damage 100 + (Base Damage 100, from Strength) + (Base Damage 100 * 7, 700, from Shadow Form) = 900
