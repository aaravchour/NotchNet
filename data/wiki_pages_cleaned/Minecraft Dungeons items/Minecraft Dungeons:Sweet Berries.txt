Sweet berries are a consumable food that can be found within the howling peaks DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

Sweet berries can heal over 20% of the hero's health and boosts their speed for five seconds.

Sweet berries can be found in abundance growing on bushes within the camp and within the squid coast, though they do not deal damage or reduce the speed of heroes.
