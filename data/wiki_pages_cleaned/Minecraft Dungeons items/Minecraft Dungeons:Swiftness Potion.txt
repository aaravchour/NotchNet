A swiftness potion is a consumable potion that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons.

Swiftness potions are mainly obtained by defeating mobs, and opening chests.
The common Surprise Gift armor enchantment and the common Looting weapon enchantment also have a chance to create the potion, as well as other consumables.

Swiftness potions grant the hero increased movement speed, identical to that of the boots of swiftness and the death cap mushroom. Swiftness lasts for twenty seconds and can be combined with the boots of swiftness and the death cap mushroom to temporarily double or triple the Speed effect.

A Twitter video was released featuring Adriene equipping thief armor with a swiftness potion, before racing through Creeper Woods to attack some zombies.
