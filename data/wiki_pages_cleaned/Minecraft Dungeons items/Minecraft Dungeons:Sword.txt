A sword is a melee weapon that can be found within the various missions of Minecraft Dungeons. Its unique variants are the hawkbrand, the diamond sword, and in the spooky fall event, the sinister sword. It also has some reskinned versions for specific mobs, such as the gold sword of piglins and zombified piglins, and the stone sword of wither skeletons.

Swords possess moderate power, low speed, and low range. They have a combo consisting of two side slashes and a thrust. The first two hits deal the weapon's minimum melee damage, while the third, the thrust, deals the maximum melee damage.
