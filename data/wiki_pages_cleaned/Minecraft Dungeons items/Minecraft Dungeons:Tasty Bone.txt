Wolves seem to sit idly in position, being unable to be attacked. The wolf sitting next to the tower, is able to be interacted with, which provides the hero with the pet the dog achievement.
Pet wolves follow the hero that summoned it and can be summoned repeatedly thirty seconds after the current summoned wolf has been defeated.

Basic attack
Pet wolves attack any hostile mob in sight by slightly leaning forwards to bite it.
