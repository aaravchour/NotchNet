The monkey motivator is an unused unique pickaxe variant that was scrapped during the development of the Jungle Awakens DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

Adding the monkey motivator to the inventory with an editor will crash the game when clicked on.

A monkey is an unseen mob mentioned within the item name of the monkey motivator.

According to a tweet from one of the developers, this pickaxe variant was going to feature a banana on a stick, forming the shape of a pickaxe.
