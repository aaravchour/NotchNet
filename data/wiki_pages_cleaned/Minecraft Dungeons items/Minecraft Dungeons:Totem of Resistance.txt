The totem of resistance is a unique totem of shielding variant that is currently unused within Minecraft Dungeons.

The totem of resistance cannot be obtained, it was likely planned to be in either the Jungle Awakens or Creeping Winter patches due to it being added to the game files in the 1.1.1.0 release patch, however it was never implemented into the game.

The totem of resistance would have functioned identically to the totem of shielding, with an additional unique perk that is unknown.
