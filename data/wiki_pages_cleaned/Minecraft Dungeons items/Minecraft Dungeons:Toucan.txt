The toucan is a pet mob that was added to the Cloudy Climb seasonal adventure as an unlockable reward in Minecraft Dungeons.

The toucan is a small bird mob with its overall appearance similar to the common toucan with its signature yellow beak with a pink ridge, blue eyes, and black feathers.

The toucan is purely cosmetic and does not attack enemies.

It is the one of two brand new and unique bird mobs to be added in Dungeons, the second being the raven.
