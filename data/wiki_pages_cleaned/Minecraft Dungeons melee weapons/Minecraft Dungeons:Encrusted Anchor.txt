The encrusted anchor is the unique anchor variant that can be found within the hidden depths DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

The encrusted anchor is an incredibly rusty version of the anchor, giving most of it golden look, and making some of the edges brown. It is covered and wrapped with seaweed, which makes a zigzag pattern in the middle of the anchor. It is also noticeably larger than the regular anchor at the top, with sharper and stronger edges. Despite its large size, it is wielded by the hero with just one hand.
