The beginning and the end is a unique void touched blades variant that can be found within the echoing void DLC of Minecraft Dungeons.

The weapon has a resemblance to void touched blades, the only difference is that it now possess a purplish color with golden edges and a slight chip on each sides of the blade. Additionally, the bottom of the swords seemingly resembles the shaft of a Golden Sword from the original game; having a golden handguard and pommel, and a dark purplish hilt, albeit with a slightly darker tone.

The item description mentions that the beginning and the end are two twin blades which carry dark secrets of the survivors of a doomed past expedition to the End.
