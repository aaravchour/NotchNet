The harp crossbow has the same basic abilities of its more common variant, the scatter crossbow, but fires 5 projectiles instead of 3, at a faster rate.
The arrows of the harp crossbow are each considered individually, meaning that if the hero has a 40% chance, for example, to shoot five arrows instead of one, then on average two of the arrows multiply. With multishot and other enchantments, the hero can fire more arrows.
