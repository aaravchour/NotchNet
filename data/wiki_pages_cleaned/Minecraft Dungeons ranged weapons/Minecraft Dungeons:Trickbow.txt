Trickbows have low power, low speed and moderate ammo. The quiver starts with 66 arrows.
Trickbows can be shot immediately for the minimum damage or charged for maximum damage if the ranged attack button is held down. Ranged weapons require the hero to have at least one normal arrow or a special arrow from a quiver artifact in their inventory to shoot. Heroes can also cancel shots by using the melee attack button and releasing the ranged attack button while the melee button is still held.
Damage caused by the arrows can be increased with enchantments, the Strength buff, and certain armor have ranged damage increases, such as Hunter's Armor.
