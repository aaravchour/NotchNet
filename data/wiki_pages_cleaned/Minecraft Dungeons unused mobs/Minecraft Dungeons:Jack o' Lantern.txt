A jack o' lantern is an unused mob that was scrapped during the development of Minecraft Dungeons.

Jack o' lanterns were plant-based mobs comprised of a carved pumpkin in which the face lights up when attacking. It also had a green stem below it and leaves above the carved pumpkin head. It was based off of the original game's jack o'lantern.

The only proof of its existence were its texture files, model, images, as well as footage of it being hacked into the hero's camp, and certain custom maps prior to the release of Jungle Awakens.

While not attacking, a jack o' lantern would stay underground, with only its pumpkin outside.
