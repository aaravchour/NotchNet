A mason is an unimplemented NPC in the camp who would increase the power level of the player's current gear using diamond dust. It is unknown where the Mason would have been found. On September 8th of 2020, the masons item upgrading functionality was taken over by the blacksmith, and the stall area the mason would have used was taken over by the gift wrapper.
