The trader llama was a passive animal that was removed alongside the wandering trader of Minecraft Dungeons.

The trader llama is a variant of the llama wearing a blue, red, and yellow designed carpet and headpiece while its fur is dark brown. Sometimes it is seen with a chest on its side while sometimes it carries a bunch of items on its back. Said items include a chest with two signs with an emerald on them, a lantern, and a small basket.

Broken Citadel (Cinematic)

It was purely aesthetic and only stayed within the fence near the trader's hut. However, it can still be seen along with the trader in the camp loading screen, and in the end cutscene of Echoing Void where it is seen with the trader by a campfire.
