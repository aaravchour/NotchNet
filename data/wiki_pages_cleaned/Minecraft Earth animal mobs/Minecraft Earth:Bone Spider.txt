A bone spider was a type of spider that was covered in a bone texture found only in Minecraft Earth.

Bone spiders were a boney variant of the spider. Unlike regular spiders, it possessed dark-purplish skin with four purple main eyes and four smaller eyes, and had what appeared to be various exposed bones on its body, which included a front skull, a backbone that stretched from the thorax to the abdomen, and leg bones on the sides of its legs.

Bone spiders were hostile toward players, melon golems, and furnace golems. Their melee attack dealt 3. Additionally, they shot bone shards as a ranged attack.

Bone spiders shot bone shards at players. The player took 2  6 of projectile damage upon being hit.

Bone spiders were rare mobs that were only obtainable from epic and rare adventure chests. They were also obtainable from the "Level 25" buildplate.

When killed, bone spiders dropped:

02 String 35% (720 chance)
02 Bone 40% (820 chance)
12 Bone Meal 25% (520 chance)

The bone spider, along with the jolly llama, were previously the only mobs in Minecraft Earth that cannot be obtained in any type of tappables.
The biome category of the journal revealed that bone spiders spawned in dark forests.
According to the artist that designed it, it was meant to look like it had a skeleton pattern on its body, rather than actually being made out of bones.
However, bone spiders also had the ability to shoot bone shards at players, implying that they may have been actually skeletal in some way.
