The cookie cow was a gray and white variant of the cow found only in Minecraft Earth.

Cookie cows were a blue-gray and white variant of the normal cow. Their fur was blue-gray in color, and it only covered its face, front body and legs, and its hindquarters. Its belly and horns were cream colored. It also had dark grayish eyebrows, a light grayish muzzle with white fur surrounding it, and dark hooves.

Similar to normal cows, cookie cows wandered around, mooing and breathing occasionally. They avoided water, lava, and walking off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. They fled for a few seconds when harmed.

Cookie cows were an uncommon mob drop found in cow tappables with a 2.1% chance to get one.

When killed, cookie cows dropped:

0-2 Leather
1-3 Raw Beef (Cooked Beef if killed while on fire)

The appearance of cookie cows were similar to that of an actual cow breed called the Belted Galloway.
The cookie cow was the second rarest cow variant in Minecraft Earth, with a 2.4% chance of getting one in tappables.
