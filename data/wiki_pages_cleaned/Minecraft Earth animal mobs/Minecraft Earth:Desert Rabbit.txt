A desert rabbit was a cream variant of the rabbit, found only in Minecraft Earth.

Desert rabbits were a cream variant of the rabbit. The entirety of its fur was cream. Its nose was pink and its eyes were dark brown in color.

Similar to ordinary rabbits, desert rabbits had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, and avoiding lava and cliffs that were enough to cause fall damage.

Desert rabbits were an uncommon mob mob drop found in tappables.

When killed, desert rabbits dropped:

0-1 Rabbit hide
0-1 Raw Rabbit (Cooked Rabbit if killed while on fire)
Rabbit's foot (10% chance of dropping)
