The freckled rabbit was a freckled variant of the rabbit found only in Minecraft Earth.

Freckled rabbits were a freckled variant of the rabbit. They possessed a white coat of fur and various freckles and spots around its rear, hind legs, and back of the head. These freckles and spots were brown, grey, and black in color, giving the appearance that it was covered in dirt. They possessed black eyes and grey front paws.

Similar to ordinary rabbits, freckled rabbits had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs that are enough to cause fall damage.

Freckled rabbits were an uncommon mob drop from grass and pond tappables.

When killed, freckled rabbits dropped:

0-1 Rabbit hide
0-1 Raw Rabbit (Cooked Rabbit if killed while on fire)
Rabbit's foot (10% chance of dropping)
