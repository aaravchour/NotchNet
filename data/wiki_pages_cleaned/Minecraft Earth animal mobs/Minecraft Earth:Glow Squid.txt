The glow squid was a variant of a squid, but with an animated and luminescent texture.

The glow squid was a bioluminescent variant of the normal squid. Their skin was light blue-green and its head and body was filled with bioluminescent spots and had glowing eyes, with a patch of them on the side of its face and one below the left eye. Their tentacles also glowed but only on the lower tips. It also had a bioluminescent mouth.

Glow squids had the same behavior as squids.

Glow squids were uncommon mobs found in marsh tappables. They were also found more commonly under water that had a frozen over top layer.
