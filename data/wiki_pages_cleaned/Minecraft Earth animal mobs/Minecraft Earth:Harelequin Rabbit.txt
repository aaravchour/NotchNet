The harelequin rabbit was a passive mob and a variant of the rabbit found only in Minecraft Earth.

Harelequin rabbits were a variant of the rabbit with three prominent colors, which made it different from the normal rabbit. Their head was black with a white muzzle, and brownish tips on the ears. Their upper half was white, while their lower half was black, separated by a brown stripe. Their feet ended in white tips.

Similar to ordinary rabbits, harelequin rabbits had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs that are enough to cause fall damage.

Harelequin rabbits were uncommon mob drops found in grass tappables and pond tappables, with them being rarer to get in grass tappables with a 2.1% chance of getting one, while in pond tappables, they were more common with a 3.0% of getting one.

When killed, the harelequin rabbits dropped:

0-1 Rabbit Hide
0-1 Raw Rabbit (Cooked Rabbit if killed while on fire)
Rabbit's foot (10% chance of dropping)

The harelequin rabbit was the only variant of the rabbit with more than two colors of fur, with three present on it.
The word "Harelequin" is a portmanteau of words "hare" and "harlequin".
