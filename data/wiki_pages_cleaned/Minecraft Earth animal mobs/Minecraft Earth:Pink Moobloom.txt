The Pink Moobloom was an unused and old variant of the moolip exclusively found in Minecraft Earth.

The pink moobloom was an unused and old variant of the moolip. Unlike the moolip, it possessed bright pink fur and and slightly pinkish spots, differing from the moolip which is light pink and has white spots. It also possessed dark pink fur streaks near its hooves that go in jagged patterns, and on its back were 4 small pink flowers, all in the same placement as the moolip's pink daisies. It also possessed a dark grey muzzle.

The flowers on its back have a similar texture to buttercups, but are pink.
These were likely an earlier version of the pink daisies found on moolips, though it's possible that they were originally intended to be a pink variant of the buttercup, or another flower entirely.
