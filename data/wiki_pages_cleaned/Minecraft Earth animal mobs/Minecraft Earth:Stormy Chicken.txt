The stormy chicken was a variant of the chicken with a dark-gray head and light-gray feathers found exclusively in Minecraft Earth.

Stormy chickens were a stormy grey variant of the chicken. Unlike normal chickens, they had all gray feathers, albeit different shades with light gray for its body and dark gray for its head. They noticeably had a darker, more orange beak and legs, differing it from the normal chicken.

Stormy chickens acted exactly the same as normal chickens, walking aimlessly and avoiding lava.

Stormy chickens were of uncommon rarity, and had a 7.2% chance of being obtained from chicken tappables.

When killed, stormy chickens dropped:

0-2 Feather
1 Raw Chicken (Cooked Chicken if killed while on fire)
