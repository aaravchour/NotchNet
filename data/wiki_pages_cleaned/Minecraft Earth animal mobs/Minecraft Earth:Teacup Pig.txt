A Teacup Pig was an unused small type of pig seen only in Minecraft Earth's farewell tweet, where it is seen within a Flower Pot.

A teacup pig appears to be a rather tiny type of pig. Its body and head is smaller, and it has dot-like eyes and a large pink snout. Its size is around that of a silverfish.

Due to it being unused, not much is known about its behavior, other than the fact that it would have had the ability to jump into flower pots.

The mob's name was confirmed within the now-archived Minecraft Earth Discord server by one of the former devs, Flexology.
In addition to its name, he also confirmed its size, some aspects of its behavior, and his plans for the mob which were unrealized due to the game's discontinuation.
He also joked about the mob needing to be seen with a Spyglass due to its small size.
