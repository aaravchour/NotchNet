A vested rabbit was a variant of the rabbit with gray fur patches found only in Minecraft Earth.

Vested rabbits were a variant of the rabbit with white fur, with a gray patch of fur covering the face and up until the base of the ears. They also resembled the "Toast" rabbit skin. Their lower-half body was light gray running down to their feet, which ended with a dark-gray patch. They had dark eyes.

Similar to ordinary rabbits, vested rabbits had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs that are enough to cause fall damage.

Vested rabbits were of an uncommon rarity and were found in grass and pond tappables, with it being rather hard to obtain in grass tappables with a 2.0% chance of getting one. It was also one of the prizes in the Season 4 prize map.

Just like any other rabbit variant, vested rabbits dropped the same items when killed:

0-1 Rabbit Hide
0-1 Raw Rabbit (Cooked Rabbit if killed while on fire)
Rabbit's Foot (10% chance of dropping)
