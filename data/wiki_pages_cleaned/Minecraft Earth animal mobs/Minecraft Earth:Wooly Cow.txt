The wooly cow was a wooly variant of the cow found only in Minecraft Earth, being based off of Highland Cattle.

Wooly cows were wooly variants of normal cows. They possessed a thick brown coat which drooped from its body and face, covering its other eye. They had slightly brown skin, seperated brown hooves, white horns, and a pink muzzle. Their overall appearance made them resemble Highland Cattle, which have similar traits.

Similar to normal cows, wooly cows wandered around, mooing and breathing occasionally. They avoided water, lava and walking off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. They fled for a few seconds when harmed.

Wooly cows were an uncommon mob drop and had a 4.1% chance to be obtained from cow tappables.

When killed, an adult wooly cow dropped:

0-2 Leather
13 Raw Beef (Cooked Beef if killed while on fire).
1 Brown Wool. (Wooly cows that have not regrown their wool do not drop more wool.)
When sheared, a wooly cow dropped 12 Brown Wool.

Similar to a normal cow resembling the Norwegian Red, the wooly cow resembled the Highland cattle.
The biome category of the journal revealed that wooly cows spawned in snowy tundras.
