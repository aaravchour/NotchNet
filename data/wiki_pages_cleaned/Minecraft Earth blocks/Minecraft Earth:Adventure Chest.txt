An Adventure Chest was a type of block in Minecraft Earth that could be found in adventures, which had 5 variants.

In some adventures, the chest would generate with the adventure, but in others the players would have to either solve a puzzle or kill all the hostile mobs in the level for it to appear. The chest wasn't always immediately visible, so players may have had to mine in the adventure in order to uncover it. Breaking it would give all participating players a number of rare items. There were 5 types of adventure chests, with each type having a different rarity, and with rarer types containing more valuable items.

(Legendary adventures had not yet been implemented when Minecraft Earth was discontinued, so legendary adventure chests never spawned naturally in-game.)
