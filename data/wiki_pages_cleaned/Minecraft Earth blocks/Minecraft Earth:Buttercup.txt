The Buttercup was an item in Minecraft Earth. Mooblooms had buttercups growing on their backs, and were able to be sheared to get the item. Mooblooms also planted them just by walking around.

Buttercups were obtainable from grass or marsh tappables.

A moobloom also dropped one buttercup when sheared.
In Adventures, a moobloom planted flowers while walking, of which 20% were buttercups.

The buttercup was included with the Moobloom in the Minecraft Live 2020 mob vote. Neither are currently planned to be added to Minecraft.
