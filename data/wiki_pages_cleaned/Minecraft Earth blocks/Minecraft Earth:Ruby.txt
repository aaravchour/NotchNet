The ruby was the unit of currency used in Minecraft Earth.

Rubies were used to purchase buildplates, boosts, mobs of me, and to speed up crafting and smelting tasks. Rubies used to be purchasable from the store in the following amounts:

Stack of Rubies (40 ) for $1.99.
Ruby Block (105 ) for $4.99.
Chest of Rubies (220 ) for $9.99.
Cart of Rubies (450 ) for $19.99.
Trove of Rubies (950 ) for $39.99.
Mine of Rubies (2,000 ) for $79.99.
House of Rubies (10,000 ) for $249.
Village of Rubies (300,696 ) for 999.
These were only offered if a player didnt have enough rubies to purchase an item.

Before 0.33.0, players were able to purchase rubies in the in-game shop, in amounts of 40 and higher, with discounts for larger purchases.
Rubies were also obtainable in two other ways:

Opening tappables
Completing challenges and adventures

Before Minecraft Earth, rubies were planned to be the currency for villager trading, but were ultimately replaced by emeralds.
Unlike the used one, the unused version of the ruby item is located in the same folder as the other inventory items, suggesting they might have been planning on implementing it as an actual item rather than just a currency at some point.
