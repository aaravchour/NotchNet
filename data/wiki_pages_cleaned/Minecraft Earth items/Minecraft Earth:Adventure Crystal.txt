An Adventure Crystal was an item in Minecraft Earth that allowed the player to place a private adventure at any location and invite friends to join the adventure. These Adventure Crystals' purpose was to create adventures without the need for the user to go outside due to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic (which eventually became the reason for the game's discontinuation).

An adventure crystal could be obtained from:

Chest tappables
Adventure Chests
Daily login challenges

Adventure crystals had different rarities:

Common Adventure Crystal
Uncommon Adventure Crystal
Rare Adventure Crystal
Epic Adventure Crystal
Legendary Adventure Crystal
Rarer crystals generated larger adventures, and contained more valuable loot in the adventure chest. The player's crystal inventory could hold a maximum of three crystals of each type.
