A bucket of mud was a bucket filled with mud.

A bucket of mud was obtainable by using a bucket on mud. The source block was consumed in the process. 

It was also obtainable from tappables as a rare item.

Using a full bucket of mud on a solid block placed a mud source block against that block, emptying the bucket.
If a bucket of mud was placed next to a water source or in water, the mud source block was destroyed.
Muddy pigs were attracted to mud, but other variants of pigs weren't.
