A horn was a rare item dropped by a horned sheep.

Horns were obtainable by killing horned sheep when they were wearing their full coat of wool. 
They were also obtainable from tappables.

Horns had no use in crafting, or anything useful, other than being decorative items.

In the horned sheep's loot table, the drop for the horn contained the function: "minecraft:set_data_from_color_index", implying that the color of the horned sheep's wool had an effect on the horn that dropped from it.
