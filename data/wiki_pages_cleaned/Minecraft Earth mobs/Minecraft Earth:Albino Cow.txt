The albino cow was a variant of the cow covered in white fur and skin, exclusively found in Minecraft Earth.

Albino cows were a white variant of the cow with their entire body covered in a white coat of fur and pale skin. The only parts of their body that had other colors were their hooves, which were pale brown in color, their slightly pale red eyes, their beige-colored horns, and their pinkish muzzle.

Similar to normal cows, albino cows wandered around, mooing and breathing occasionally. They avoided water, lava, and walking off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. They fled for a few seconds when harmed.

Albino cows were obtainable from cow tappables, with a 4.6% chance and an uncommon rarity. They were also previously obtained as a reward in Season 5.

When killed, albino cows dropped:

0-2 Leather
1-3 Raw Beef (Cooked Beef if killed while on fire)
