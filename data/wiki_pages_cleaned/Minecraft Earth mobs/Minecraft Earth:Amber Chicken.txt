An amber chicken was a variant of the chicken with amber-colored feathers exclusively found in Minecraft Earth.

Amber chickens were a golden yellow variant of the chicken. As its name implied, its plumage was amber-colored and almost resembled the color gold. It had an apricot-colored beak and legs differing it from the normal chicken.

Amber chickens acted exactly the same as normal chickens, walking aimlessly, and avoiding lava. 

Amber chickens were uncommon mob drops that were obtainable from chicken tappables, with a 2.1% chance to get one.

When amber chickens were killed, they dropped one of these items:

0-2 Feather
1 Raw Chicken (Cooked Chicken if killed while on fire)

Amber chickens were previously rarer than cluckshrooms, even though they are of uncommon rarity, and cluckshrooms are of rare rarity.
