The ashen cow was a variant of the cow with a gray coat of fur found only in Minecraft Earth.

Ashen cows were a gray-colored variant of the cow. Their fur was light-gray in color with a gray underbelly. Their back had a dark-gray stripe running from the head toward the rear. Unlike the normal cow, their nose was a slightly darker gray and they had grayish tips on their horns. They also possessed dark hooves.

Similar to normal cows, ashen cows wandered around, mooing and breathing occasionally. They avoided water, lava and walking off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage. They fled for a few seconds when harmed.

Ashen cows were uncommon mobs found in cow tappables, with a 8.1% chance of getting one.

When killed, ashen cows dropped:

0-2 Leather
1-3 Raw Beef ( Cooked Beef if killed while on fire)
