The Bronzed Chicken was a vibrant-colored variant of the chicken found only in Minecraft Earth.

Bronzed chickens were a vibrantly-colored variant of the chicken. Their head was rusty bronze in color, hence the name. Their front feathers were teal-blue in color with a dark teal underbelly, while their back feathers were light indigo in color. They possessed light silvery legs.

Bronzed chickens acted exactly the same as normal chickens, walking aimlessly, and avoiding lava.

Bronzed chickens were an uncommon rarity and were found in chicken tappables with a 2.1% chance to get one. They were also obtainable from the Season 8 prize map where the player collected 5 gold ores in adventures.

When bronzed chickens were killed, they dropped:

0-2 Feather
1 Raw Chicken (Cooked Chicken if killed while on fire)
