A Dyed Cat was a variant of a cat with dyed purple fur found only in Minecraft Earth.
Dyed cats were never added into the game, though one with the name Peanut Butter usually appears with Merl in promotional material. The name was announced with the Series 19 mini figures. It also appeared as a minifigure in a LEGO Minecraft set called The First Adventure.

Dyed cats are a dyed variant of the cat. Unlike the normal cat, they possess a unique coat pattern with gunmetal grey fur and paws and a light grey underbelly, which is coated with the mob's signature purple splotch of dye, which covers part of the head and front body, and is seen to be dripping off the side. They also possess a purple nose and eyes, and a white muzzle.

Peanut Butter was an official mascot character of Minecraft Earth. Peanut Butter is a constant companion found loyally by the side of Merl, who is the only other mascot character in Minecraft Earth.
Peanut Butter appears mostly with Merl in various promotional material.
