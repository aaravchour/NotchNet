The flecked sheep was a variant of the sheep with brown wool and a white head, found only in Minecraft Earth.

Flecked sheep were a brown-wooled variant of the normal sheep. The appearance itself almost made it resemble a normal sheep that was just dyed with brown dye, but there were a few notable differences. Its head and lower patches of wool near its legs were pure white, leaving the rest of its wool being rich brown in color.

Similar to normal sheep, flecked sheep had the same AI behavior. They wandered aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs high enough to cause fall damage.

Flecked sheep were of an uncommon rarity with a 4.8% chance of obtaining it from sheep tappables.

When sheared, flecked sheep dropped 1-6 Brown Wool.
When killed, flecked sheep dropped:

1 Brown Wool
1 Raw Mutton (Cooked Mutton if killed while on fire)
