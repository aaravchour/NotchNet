The gold crested chicken was a gold-topped variant of the chicken found only in Minecraft Earth.

Gold-crested chickens were a golden-topped variant of the chicken. As their name implied, their upper feathers, head, and wings were golden-yellow in color, and their lower body and feathers were white, making it resemble a chick that just hatched with its eggshell stuck on its legs. Its beak and legs had a yellowish or caramel-like tinge. 

Gold crested chickens acted exactly the same as normal chickens, walking aimlessly, and avoiding lava.

Gold crested chickens were uncommon mob drops that were only obtainable from chicken tappables.

When gold crested chickens were killed, they dropped:

0-2 Feather
1 Raw Chicken (Cooked Chicken if killed while on fire)
