Merl appears mostly with her Dyed Cat, Peanut Butter, in various promotional material.

Merl has bright pink hair, slightly brown skin, a mouth, and eyes with dark purple irises. Her hair is seen drooping to the left. She wears a brown shirt with a white neckline and short cuffs, brown patches under her sleeves, and on the middle is a design of Earth with a shadow behind it, and she also wears a brown backpack.
