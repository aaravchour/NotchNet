The mottled pig was a mottled variant of the pig found only in Minecraft Earth.

Mottled pigs were a mottled variant of the pig. As their name implied, their skin was a mottled dark-brown in color, resembling dark wood. Their feet were slightly pale grey in color and it possessed brownish eyebrows and a dark-brown nose. Unlike the normal pig, their nostrils went upwards instead of forward facing, and their eyes were pointed towards the center, rather than being turned out.

Like the average pig, mottled pigs had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, dodging lava and cliffs.

Mottled pigs were an uncommon mob drop found in pig tappables.

When killed, mottled pigs dropped:

13 Raw Porkchop (Cooked Porkchop if killed while on fire)

The biome category of the journal revealed that Mottled Pigs spawned in the forest.
