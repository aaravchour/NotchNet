The pale pig was a passive mob that served as a pale variant of the pig found in Minecraft Earth.

Pale pigs were a pale variant of the normal pig. They possessed a very light pink skin color covering most of their body, reaching an almost white hue on the upper body and on the legs.

Like the average pig, pale pigs had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, dodging lava and cliffs.

Pale pigs were of uncommon rarity and found in pig tappables, with a 5.5% chance to get one. They were also obtainable from the Season 6 prize map.

When killed, the pale pigs dropped:

1-3 Raw Porkchop (Cooked Porkchop if killed while on fire)

Pale pigs somewhat resembled the Chester White, which is a pale breed of pigs.
One of the quests to get it in Season 6 was to place a pale pig on a buildplate.
The biome category of the journal revealed that pale pigs spawned in snowy tundras.
