The piebald pig was a passive mob that served as a piebald variant of the pig found in Minecraft Earth.

Piebald pigs were the piebald variant of the normal pig. Their whole body was cream-colored with a large brownish patch near their rear end. They had a small brown spot on top of their head and on three of their legs, with two on their front left leg and one on their hind left leg. They possessed a dark brown tail and light brown hooves.

Like the average pig, piebald pigs had the same AI behavior, wandering aimlessly, dodging lava and cliffs.

Piebald pigs were of uncommon rarity and found in pig tappables, with a 5.2% chance of getting one.

When killed, the piebald pigs dropped:

1-3 Raw Porkchop (Cooked Porkchop if killed while on fire)

Piebald pigs somewhat resembled the Danish Protest, which is a Piebald breed of pigs.
The biome category of the journal revealed that piebald pigs spawned in the forest.
