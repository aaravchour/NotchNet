A rocky sheep was a sheep variant with white wool with black blotches found only in Minecraft Earth.

Rocky sheep were a variant of the sheep with various black blotches found on their wool. They had two dark blotches on both sides of their face and a large blotch near their right leg. Their wool seemed to blend into a slightly grayish color as a result of the blotches. They possessed a rather bright pink-colored nose.

Similar to normal sheep, rocky sheep had the same AI behavior. They wandered aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs high enough to cause fall damage.

Rocky sheep were an uncommon mob drop found in sheep tappables, with a 3.9% chance of getting one.

When sheared, rocky sheep dropped 1-3 Gray Wool.
When killed, rocky sheep dropped:

1 Gray Wool
1 Raw Mutton (Cooked Mutton if killed while on fire)
