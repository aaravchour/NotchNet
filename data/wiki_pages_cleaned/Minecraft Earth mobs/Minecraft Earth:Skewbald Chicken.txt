The skewbald chicken was a skewbald variant of the chicken, found only in Minecraft Earth.

Skewbald chickens were a brown-and-white variant of the chicken. Its upper feathers surrounding its head and near the wings were marble-white in color, and its back feathers were darkish brown in color. Its beak and legs were saturated in color, somewhat resembling fleshtone colors.

Skewbald chickens acted exactly the same as normal chickens, walking aimlessly, and avoiding lava.

Skewbald chickens were an uncommon mob drop found in chicken tappables. They were also obtainable as a reward in Season 17.

When skewbald chickens were killed, they dropped:

0-2 Feather
1 Raw Chicken (Cooked Chicken if killed while on fire)
