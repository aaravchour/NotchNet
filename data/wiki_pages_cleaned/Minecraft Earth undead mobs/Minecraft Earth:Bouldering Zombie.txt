The bouldering zombie was a gray-skinned variant of the zombie capable of climbing up blocks, found only in Minecraft Earth.

The bouldering zombie was a gray variant of the zombie that was capable of climbing up blocks like a spider. Unlike normal zombies, it possessed dark stone-colored skin, a dark greyish head, a more serious expression and face, and had slightly bigger arms (2 pixels longer and 1 pixel wider) and closed fists. it wore a dark orange shirt and dark brownish-gray pants.

Bouldering zombies mostly acted like normal zombies in terms of damage and behavior, attacking players, mobs of me, furnace golems, and melon golems by walking up to and attacking them. However, they were also capable of scaling up blocks like a spider. This behavior was triggered when they saw a player above blocks, where they then proceeded to climb the blocks and then attack the player.

Bouldering zombies were rare mob drops that were only obtainable from rare and epic adventure chests. They were also obtainable as a reward in Season 15.

When killed, the Bouldering Zombie dropped:

0-2 Rotten Flesh
Potato (2.5% chance of dropping)
Carrot (2.5% chance of dropping)
Iron Ingot (2.5% chance of dropping)

The biome category of the journal revealed that bouldering zombies spawned in plains.
It, along with the lobber zombie, were the first and only zombie variants exclusive to Minecraft Earth.
Unlike other zombie variants in different games, they were given unique and slightly altered models, with their arms having different widths and lengths, and unique animations for throwing and climbing.
