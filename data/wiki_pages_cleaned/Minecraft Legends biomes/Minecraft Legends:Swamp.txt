A swamp is a lush flooded biome within Minecraft Legends.

Swamps are largely flooded and have less ground area than other biomes, they are populated by large mangrove trees. Wood, stone, and redstone are the three resources that can be found in swamps. Speed wheat, bounce caps, and red-thorns can be found in this biome.
