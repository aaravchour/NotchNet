A geyser is an obstacle that launches entities into the air in Minecraft Legends.

Geysers can be found in flat areas in tundra biomes.

Every few seconds the geyser will release a jet of water upwards into the air, any entities that are in close proximity to this jet of water are also launched into the air and take fall damage when landing.
