The Ancient Hoglin is a large hoglin that can be seen within the various cutscenes of Minecraft Legends.

The Ancient Hoglin is a hoglin that is bigger and stronger than the regular hoglins with multiple tusks and boils.

The Ancient Hoglin could be seen being chased by The Beast during multiple cutscenes alongside several hoglins. It managed to escape from The Beast due to it being forced to go through a portal by The Seer.

The Ancient Hoglin's first appearance was in the Portal Dash board game, where its name was revealed.
In the game files, Hoglins have no internal classification, instead being grouped together with the Piglins despite not being a Piglin.
