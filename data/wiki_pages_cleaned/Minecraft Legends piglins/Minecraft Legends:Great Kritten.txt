The Great Kritten, also known as Kritten, is an fugitive piglin alchemist within Minecraft Legends: Return of the Piglins. His name was initially mistaken as Krit-En by Farnum due to the language barrier.

It is currently unknown as to what Kritten looks like in full, though early on they are described as short (half the size of Bungus and Uggub) and wearing a cloak. As such, it can be inferred that they dont resemble a typical piglin.

Krittens primary career was as an advisor, helping many piglins achieve power over the years and telling them exactly what they needed to hear. This culminated in them helping Bungus dethrone the Great Grungert, the leader of the largest bastion in the dimension. Things seemed to have once again gone as planned for Kritten, with Bungus keeping them on board as their primary advisor and confidant. However, over time the two grew distant, with Bungus becoming meaner, ungrateful, and borderline toxic towards their once-friend, even as they continued to work under their reign. Not helping matters was the hiring of Uggub, a piglin brute that openly resented Kritten at any opportunity.

Due to their role as an advisor, its possible that Kritten is intended to be a descendant (or at least a parallel) to The Seer.
