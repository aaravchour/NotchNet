A Messenger Piglin, also known as a Grunter, was a type of piglin that relayed information to the piglin horde generals.

Messenger Piglins generally look like Blaze Runts and Mace Runts.

During the war many Messenger Piglins were seen giving information to The Great Hog, The Beast, The Devourer and The Unbreakable after the Hero and allied mobs beat many piglin bases and the Night Beacon base.
