A seeker is a piglin affiliated with the Horde of the Spore and Horde of the Hunt of Minecraft Legends.

Seekers spawn from Piglin Pits in Piglin Bases and Outposts. They can also spawn randomly in any Biome.

Seekers idle around holding an explosive mushroom. Once the seeker finds a target it will run towards them and throw their explosive mushrooms at them, though they damage themselves in the process. Seekers can swim when on water.
