A piglin key is a resource used to open piglin chests within Minecraft Legends.

Piglin keys have a chance to be dropped by any piglin units upon death, however there is a higher drop chance if the piglin defeated is a tougher unit or a boss.

Piglin keys can be used to open chests found within piglin outposts.
