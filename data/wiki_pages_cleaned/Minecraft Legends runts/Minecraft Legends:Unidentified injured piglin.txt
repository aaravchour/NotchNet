The unidentified injured piglin was an unidentified piglin runt that was injured within a piglin outpost of Minecraft Legends.

The unidentified injured piglin was a piglin that was injured after the hero destroyed a nether portal belonging to the horde of the spore. This piglin went back into the nether with bandages and tried to get The Devourer's attention to tell it that the another nether portal had been destroyed, but the piglin was not successful. The devourer charged into the portal the injured piglin was near, entering into it, though one of the devourer's pink spores fell onto the the injured piglin's back, causing the piglin to try to eat it.
