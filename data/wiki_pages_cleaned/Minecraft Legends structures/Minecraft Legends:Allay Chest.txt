An allay chest is a chest that can be opened by gather allays within Minecraft Legends.

Allay chests can be found in any biome, they are usually found in high up or hard to access areas.

One gather allay is needed in order to open Allay chests. An arrangement of resources or more allays would be obtained once the chest is open. The resources found in an allay chest depends on the biome it spawns in.
