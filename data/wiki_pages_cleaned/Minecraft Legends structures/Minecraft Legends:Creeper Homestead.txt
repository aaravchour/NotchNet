A creeper homestead is an ally structure in Minecraft Legends.

Creeper homesteads are composed of multiple shallow pools of bright green acid which creepers seem to bathe in harmlessly, with a bulbous rock formation in their center, and multiple fencepost-like rocks that are similar in appearance to cut sandstone blocks scattered around. The rock formations have stripes in multiple hues of yellow and orange, and taper off into a few short twisting spires at the top. Blocks touching the acid have their sides stained a deep green.
The fencepost-like rocks are shown to spew smoke within cutscenes, but this behaviour isn't seen in-game.

Creeper homesteads will spawn in one of the badlands biomes in the overworld.
