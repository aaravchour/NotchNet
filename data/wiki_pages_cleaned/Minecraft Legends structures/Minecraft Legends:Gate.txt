A gate is a defensive structure in Minecraft Legends.

Gates can be placed by using a build allay and spending 150 wood.

Campaign
Gates will open when the hero and allied units are close by. Gates will not open if an enemy is close by.

PVP
Gates function exactly as above with the addition that they will open when a team member of the player who placed the gate is close by.
