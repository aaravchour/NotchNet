A kaboomery is a structure that buffs other structures in Minecraft Legends.

A kaboomery can be placed by using a build allay, which will cost 250 wood and 150 coal.

When placed, a kaboomery creates a zone around itself. Any arrow towers, scatter towers, or redstone launchers in this zone are given an explosive shot which increases their damage. If the kaboomery is destroyed, all affected structures lose their explosive shot.
