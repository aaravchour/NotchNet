A lapis flag is a structure that provides lapis within Minecraft Legends.

Lapis flags can be placed by using a build allay, which costs 25 lapis, 100, prismarine, and 300 stone.

Campaign
Lapis flags provide the hero with more lapis over time. If more than one lapis flag is created, then the hero would gain more lapis.

PVP
Lapis flags function the same as they do within the campaign, however, they provide all of the players on the team with more lapis over time.
