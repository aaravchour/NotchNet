A nether spreader is a piglin-built structure within Minecraft Legends.

Nether spreaders spawn in piglin bases and piglin outposts.

Nether spreaders poison the ground with Netherrack that spreads to nearby blocks and allows only piglins to build structures on it. Once they are destroyed, the ground can turn back to normal. If there is a terror horn nearby, it will be upgraded to emit orange lightning particles and have a wider range when spreading Netherrack and deal more damage to mobs.
