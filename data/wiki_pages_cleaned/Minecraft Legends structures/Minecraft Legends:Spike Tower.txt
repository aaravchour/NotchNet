A spike tower is a piglin-built structure within Minecraft Legends. It attacks by throwing a large explosive spike at enemies.

Spike tower spawns in piglin bases.

Piglins use the spike tower to defend piglin bases by shooting large, spiked projectiles that explodes into smaller pieces which explodes to damage mobs.

The spike tower is confused with the furnace tower in game.
