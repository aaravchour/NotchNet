A spyglass overlook is a structure that buffs other structures in Minecraft Legends.

A spyglass overlook can be placed by selecting it in the hotbar and using a build allay, spending 50 wood, 100 stone and 200 diamond.       

Campaign
The spyglass creates a zone around itself once placed. Any arrow towers, scatter towers, or redstone launchers that are in this range have their range increased. If the spyglass overlook is destroyed, all affected buildings lose their increased range.
