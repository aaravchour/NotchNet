The Well of Fate is a structure that can be found within Minecraft Legends.

The Well of Fate allows the hero to obtain new types of allies or increase the number of allies that they can rally up. The Well of Fate also allows fast travelling via the map.

The Well of Fate has a remarkably similar structure to an Ocean Monument. Furthermore, both are made of prismarine, suggesting that the hosts may have created both.
In minecraft dungeons, hidden depth dlc level picture, top of the abyssial monument is similar with the base of the well of fate. They all have four pillars of different heights, top of the monument has a light source same as the well of fate. The music disc "Relic" in minecraft also has part of the sound track "O2" (when players drown in abyssial monument,it will be played) and "well of fate".
