For the base game counterpart, see Blaze.
Blazes are fiery hostile mobs that originate from the Nether in Minecraft: Story Mode. They only appeared in "Order Up!" spawned from spawn eggs by Aiden to attack Jesse.

Like their base counterparts, blazes attack players with fireballs and float up to avoid close attacks. They are also weak to water. Unlike base game blazes, however, they are capable of a charged attack in which they ram into players. This was seen when Jesse nearly missed its attack with the blaze getting damaged by water trying to ram him.

Blazes in Story Mode look similar in texture to their base counterparts with the only exception of possessing movable pupils and yellowish eyes and more yellowish rods that float around them. They also emit less smoke and are seen lighting themselves ablaze as a warning of when they attack.

In "Order Up!", two blazes were spawned through spawn eggs by Aiden to attack Jesse, the first is killed by Jesse with his/her enchanted diamond sword and the second dies due to the rain's damage and missing its ram onto Jesse.

Despite originating from the Nether, they only appeared in the game from spawn eggs and were not seen later in the game, such as in the Sunshine Institute.
