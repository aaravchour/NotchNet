Endermites or ender-mites are hostile mobs in Minecraft Story Mode that appeared in "A Portal to Mystery" as a trap set for Jesse.

Endermites in Story Mode are different in model from the base game as they use the Silverfish's model and a lighter purple body. They also have black eyes like the silverfish and a black tail.

In "A Portal to Mystery", The White Pumpkin has a portal chamber filled with countless endermites which is used as a death trap for Jesse's Gang.

The Endermites in "A Portal to Mystery" are the old version of the Endermite which was a silverfish model with a purple texture.
Currently, they have only a single, square segment with a head on one side, and have one red eye.
Endermites also had a 5% chance to spawn when an ender pearl is thrown. It is unknown if The White Pumpkin used this method to create them (although considering how wasteful it is, this is unlikely).
Cassie Rose claimed that Endermites were "eternally hungry", however, this is not true, as they despawn after 2 minutes in the base game.
In the subtitles of Minecraft Story Mode, endermites are referred to as "Ender-mites".
