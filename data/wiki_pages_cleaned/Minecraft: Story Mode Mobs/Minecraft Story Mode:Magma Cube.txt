For the mob in the original game, see Magma Cube.

Magma cubes are hostile mobs and slime variants that appeared in Minecraft Story Mode. They first appeared as a mob head in "Hero in Residence" and appeared physically in "Below the Bedrock" where Jesse, Petra, and Radar encounter a few in one of Romeo's challenges.

Like base game magma cubes, they attack the player head-on, however, they only take one hit before dying, making them quite weak. They also don't split upon death.

Magma cubes in Story Mode appear the same in appearance with the exception that they were made by Romeo, as on the top of their heads, they possess a red glowing symbol similar to those seen behind the heads of prismarine soldiers. They are also capable of solidifying into a cobblestone-like state upon contact with water. They also bounce with their last layer staying near the ground, differing it from the base game magma cube.

In "Hero in Residence", a few magma cube mob heads appear in Jack & Nurm's Adventure Emporium.
In "Below the Bedrock", magma cubes, along with magma golems, appeared during Romeo's challenge room in Romeoburg.

Although they only spawn in the Nether, they have not been seen there in the game, instead spawned. This is the same case for blazes.
In this case however, created, as these magma cubes have Romeo's symbol on their heads.
They are the first mobs alongside magma golems and their giant counterpart to turn or solidify into a mineable object upon contact of certain elements, in their case, water.
This concept was later applied to the now unimplemented mob, the copper golem in which it oxidizes into a statue for a certain time, making it possibly mineable if implemented.
