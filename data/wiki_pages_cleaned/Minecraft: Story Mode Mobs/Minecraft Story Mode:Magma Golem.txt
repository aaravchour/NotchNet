Magma golems are a magma variant of the iron golem that appeared in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. They appeared in "Below the Bedrock" as enemies summoned in one of Romeo's challenges.

Besides being designed by Romeo, they are built with magma blocks and jack o'lanterns as an iron golem would replacing the iron blocks with magma blocks. A redstone contraption puts the blocks together causing them to spawn.

Magma golems, other than having the base strength of a normal iron golem, have a unique ability of causing fire damage as it swings its arms at a player.

Magma golems are a rocky magma variant of the iron golem composed of magma blocks and a jack o'lantern. Their bodies are charcoal black in color with various lava cracks seen on its torso, arms, and legs. On their chest, they seem to have a large spot or impact. They lastly have red-orange lava eyes and on the backs of their heads, they have the same glowing symbol as the prismarine soldiers.

In "Below the Bedrock" when Jesse, Radar, and Petra try to get to Fred's Cabin, they enter Romeo's challenge room where multiple magma golems are summoned and defeated. These golems were being summoned by Romeo's redstone contraption.

Magma golems are one of many exclusive golems found only in Story Mode.
Like the magma cubes and its giant counterpart, they are one of the few mobs that turn into a mineable non-moving object once in contact with certain elements, like water.
