Parrots are passive mobs that appeared in both Minecraft Story Mode Season 1 and Season 2 where they are normally seen as pets. They come in 4 different color variations in Story Mode, namely: Red, Blue, Green, and Grey.

Like their base game counterparts, parrots can be tamed using seeds and they mostly fly and sit about. They are also capable of dancing when near a jukebox. Unlike the base game however, parrots seem to be able to fly for relatively long distances without tiring and rather quickly, they also tend to flee if a player or character goes too close. Also alike the base game, they are capable of lifting a player in cooperation with other parrots as seen with Stampy's parrots.

In "Hero in Residence", many parrots can be seen flying around Beacontown; they also appear in Champion City.
In "Giant Consequences", A blue parrot is seen inside the Icy Palace of Despair, two parrots are later seen after Jack/Petra destroy the Clock.
In "Below the Bedrock", a red parrot is seen on the Birch tree that Romeo planted for Fred.
In "Above and Beyond", several parrots are seen with Stampy, they also determinantly appear in a "Parrot Party" if Jesse places the Potato while in the Terminal Space.

If Jesse does not tell Ivor to say anything to Romeo, Radar will tell Ivor to tell Romeo that Jesse was pecked to death by "Deadly Prison Parrots."
The Cyan Parrot is the only parrot variant that has not appeared in Minecraft: Story Mode in any form.

Not to be confused with the Arch-Illager.
Archie is a red parrot and pet mob that appears only in "Above and Beyond", owned by Jack & Nurm's Adventure Emporium.

Archie is a red parrot that resembles the scarlet macaw with its red plumage and yellow and blue streaks near its wings and tail. Its head feather appears to be thickened by one pixel instead of just flat.

Archie's name is not a reference to the Arch-Illager as Story Mode came out 5 years ago, in 2015, prior to Dungeons, which was released around 2020.
