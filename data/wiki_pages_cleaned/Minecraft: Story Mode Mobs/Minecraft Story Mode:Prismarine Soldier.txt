Prismarine soldiers, also called collectively as prismarine foes are prismarine golem mobs created by Romeo protect the Sea Temple by killing intruders and guarding the Temple.

Prismarine soldiers are small prismarine golems and the smaller version of the colossi. They are all taller than the player and are made of unique shades and etches of prismarine forming patterns like a ribcage or armor. They possess two raised edges on their shoulders that resemble shoulder guards. Like their colossi counterparts, they possess tentacle-beards but the soldiers have some that curve on the ends and some that are longer than the others. On the backs of their heads, they have a glowing symbol that act as their weak spot and glowing eyes.

In "Hero in Residence", several prismarine soldiers are frozen in the room across from the treasure room where the Structure Blocks are shown. After Jesse chooses a structure block, the prismarine soldiers break into the room and attack Jesse's Gang.

Their name, "prismarine foes," was confirmed as a collective name in the choice statistics of "Hero in Residence". This means that the colossi can also be referred as a prismarine foe.
They have a glowing symbol on the back of their heads that acts as a weak point. When stabbed there, the glow in their eyes will fade out and they will die.
Like the colossi, their design stems from Cthulhu, especially with the signature tentacles on the face.
