Prison slimes are a red variant of the slime that appeared in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. They are seen in "Jailhouse Block" where Jesse's Gang used them as a trampoline to escape a horde of mobs.

Not much is known about their behavior as they are only seen idle and bouncing about. They are however unstartled as Jesse bounces on them to escape a mob horde. Their behavior is oddly contradictory to other mobs created by Romeo as they're normally hostile, but it is theorized that they really are hostile, just not shown in-game or in the story. Due to small and medium sizes of them appearing, its presumed that they also split when killed.

Prison slimes are a red variant of the slime created by Romeo to wander the outer perimeter of the Sunshine Institute. Their bodies are of two main colors. They have a red inner core with big black eyes and a small mouth and a transparent black outer core. 

In "Jailhouse Block", while Jesse and Petra/Jack are attempting to escape the Sunshine Institute, they encounter a large group of prison slimes and jump on them in order to escape. The slimes are not seen afterwards.

Prison slimes are one of the few mobs in the game whose original variant doesn't appear in the game.
This is the same case for the icy shulker.
As said by Eric Stirpe, the art team for "Jailhouse Block" referred these red slime variants as "Prison Slimes". 
Unlike normal slimes, these variants are never shown attacking, instead staying idle. It is only presumed that they are hostile due to them being created by Romeo.
Prison slimes are also one of the few mobs that can be used as an indirect tool as Jesse is seen bouncing off them to escape a mob horde. This is also seen with Minecraft Dungeons's clam as they lift players that stand on them.
This also differs them from base game slimes as they are incapable of bouncing players up.
