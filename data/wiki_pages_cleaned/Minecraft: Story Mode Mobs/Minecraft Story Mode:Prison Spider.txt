Prison spiders are a prison variant of the spider that appear exclusively in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. They are first seen in "Jailhouse Block" as swarms of them attack Jesse's Gang.

Like normal spiders, they jump at the player and can scale horizontal blocks.

Prison spiders are a prison variant of the spider created by Romeo to wander the outer perimeters of the Sunshine Institute. Their color seems to match their base counterparts with the exception of red dots that appear on their legs.

In "Jailhouse Block", prison spiders can be seen in The Burrows when Jesse and Petra/Jack first attempt to escape Sunshine Institute. They can also be seen when Jesse's Gang escapes the Institute with Xara.

Said by Eric Stirpe, most mobs in the Sunshine Institute was called "prison [mob name here]."
