For Sheep in the original game of Minecraft, see Sheep.
Sheep are passive mobs found in Minecraft: Story Mode.

In "The Order of the Stone", Jesse uses shears on sheep to gather wool for the Building Competition.
In "Order Up!", Jesse uses a spawn egg to spawn a sheep. Later, the sheep falls out of the basement of Sky City after a creeper explodes. It can be later seen in a water pool below the city.
In "Access Denied", during the beginning credit sequence, multiple sheep come out of a White Portal.

In vanilla Minecraft, sheep can be dyed as an efficient way to obtain colorful wool. However, in Episode 1, Jesse's Gang did not dye the sheep before harvesting their wool. The wool has color when Jesse's Gang used it in the Endercon building competition.
