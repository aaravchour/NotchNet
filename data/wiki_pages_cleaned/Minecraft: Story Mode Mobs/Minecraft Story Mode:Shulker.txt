Shulkers are hostile mobs that appeared Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. They first appeared in "Giant Consequences", and are found in the Icy Palace of Despair, used to levitate Jesse's gang into aerial traps.

Like their base game counterparts, they attack the heroes by shooting a bullet that deals damage and affects them with levitation for a certain amount of time.

Unlike their base game counterparts, they possess pale blue shulker shells and a pale white inner head. This is likely caused by the color of ambient lighting.

In "Giant Consequences", when Jesse's gang are trying to save Stella and Radar, they encounter multiple Shulkers as they get hit and float up, trying to escape. They last fired upon the gang allowing them to reach Stella and Radar.

The Shulkers that appeared in the game are just regular white shulkers. This is confirmed by Eric Stirpe.
Their appearance implies the existence of end cities within the game, outside the End where Soren made his base.
