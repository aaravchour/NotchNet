Skeletons are common hostile mobs found in both Minecraft Story Mode Season 1 and Season 2, acting as basic enemies encountered by Jesse and his friends.

Like the base game, skeletons attack players on-sight by shooting them with arrows, and being undead, they also burn in sunlight.

Skeletons in Story Mode look similar to their base game counterparts with their white-gray bones and bows, with a slight difference in their eyes and mouth as they appear lowered instead of a flat face.

In "The Order of the Stone", skeletons are among the few hostile mobs which attack Jesse and Reuben in the forest. A skeleton is also seen riding a minecart in the Nether Minecart System.
In "Assembly Required", skeletons can be seen if Jesse chooses the leave the Temple at night.
In "The Last Place You Look", there are skeletons in Soren the Architect's mob grinder.
In "A Block and a Hard Place", skeletons can be seen running away from the Wither Storm, and later in the swamp.
In "Order Up!", some skeletons fall down from Sky City to their deaths when Jesse and Isa are on the land below. They can be seen attacking the citizens after Jesse and Isa climb back up.
In "A Portal to Mystery", skeletons can be seen outside The Mansion and attack Jesse's Gang.
In "Access Denied", many skeletons are mind-controlled by PAMA.

The skeleton rig has the ability to widen/squint it's eyes but skeletons are never seen doing so in-game.
