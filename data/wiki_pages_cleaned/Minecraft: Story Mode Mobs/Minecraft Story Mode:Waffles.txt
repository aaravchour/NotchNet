Waffles is a pet mob in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two formerly owned by Fred before his death. He is determinately used to learn a fact about Fred.

Waffles resembles a normal chicken possessing all its signature features, like its white plumage and notably thick legs and feet, as such with Story Mode chickens.

Waffles allegedly could never make up his mind. Not much else is known about him due to his brief appearance and debut.

He is the second chicken in the game which has a name; the other being Benedict.
His name could be a reference to the real food: chicken and waffles and/or the fact that Waffles "waffles" down his feathers, as mentioned by Jesse. (Determinant)
