Wink is a pet wolf who appeared in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two. He is a wolf owned by Stacy Plays, and first appeared in Hero in Residence.

Wink is a normal tamed wolf, and he wears the classic red collar. When Wink is an adult, he looks like a wild wolf.

Wink is a happy puppy, and treats everyone he meets nicely. He is shown to be very excited and energetic when he meets Jesse; however, he calms down easily, as shown when Jesse gives him a bone.

He is a reference to the YouTuber Stacy Plays' wolf from her various let's plays, first appearing in Dogcraft, and was a character in the Wild Rescuers Series.
Although he is a tamed wolf, he is fed a bone. This is unlike the base game, in which tamed wolves will not take bones.
In "Above and Beyond", if Jesse does not feed Wink the rotten flesh or reveals his/her identity to him, he will be sent to the prison by Romeo, then joins the Ocelots and appears in the floating tower alongside Stacy.
