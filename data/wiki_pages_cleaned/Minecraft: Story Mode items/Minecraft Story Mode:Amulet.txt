The Amulet of the Order of the Stone is a device used to track the members of The Old Order of the Stone and the New Order.

The Amulet is a round dark metal object with gold and colored crystal-like lights
Each color present on the amulet represents a different member of the Order of The Stone:

Red stands for Ellegaard/Olivia
Navy Blue stands for Ivor/Jesse
White stands for Soren/Lukas
Green stands for Magnus/Axel
Cyan stands for Gabriel the Warrior/Petra

The amulet is designed so that when a member of the Order of the Stone is nearby, his/her respective color on the amulet glows.
The amulet can be placed inside a tracking device in The Order's Temple to create colored beams that shine onto a map. These beams show the exact locations of The Order members in The Overworld. 
The amulet cannot work in other dimensions such as The Nether or The End. It is unknown whether or not it functions in other worlds, such as The Mansion world.

In the opening cut-scene of Episode 1, Soren can be seen with the amulet. It can be assumed that he had just crafted it, because he was seen with it in front of a crafting table. It is unknown what he used to craft it.
In Episodes 5 and 8, the amulet can be seen on display inside the Order Hall.
Ellegaard's and Magnus's colors (red and green, respectively) are on opposite sides of each other. Coincidentally, red and green are on the opposite sides of each other on the RYB color wheel. This could be a reference to their conflicting personalities.
In the game files, the Amulet is referred to as a medallion.
It was confirmed by Eric Stirpe, that the amulet was reprogrammed and would then track down The New Order of the Stone. However, the navy blue light of the amulet glowed when Ivor revealed himself in "Below the Bedrock", but it did not seem to glow when he was gone, even though Jesse was nearby; this may hint that the amulet was reprogrammed back to what it was before.
