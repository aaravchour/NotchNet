Command Block Tools, referred to as Ultimate Tools in the inventory, are enchanted diamond tools/weapons that appear in Minecraft: Story Mode. They are enchanted using Ivor's Command Block Enchanted Book. The command block tools are a Minecraft: Story Mode  exclusive.

Sword
Pickaxe
Shovel
Axe
Hoe

The command block tool can destroy any item, including the command block. The details of the enchantment are unknown, as it was created with a Minecraft: Story Mode-exclusive enchanted book.

If a hoe is chosen to be enchanted, Reuben will laugh at Jesse.
Despite speculation that the tool is still intact, it was later confirmed that it was destroyed during the final hit from the command block.
In the Adventure Pass thumbnail, Jesse is shown holding the command block enchanted sword, even though they use a normal enchanted sword in the Adventure Pass.
In the Netflix Adaption of Minecraft Story Mode, the appearance of The Command Block Axe and Hoe does not appear as they do in the original game. Instead, they use the appearance of a regular enchanted tool.
