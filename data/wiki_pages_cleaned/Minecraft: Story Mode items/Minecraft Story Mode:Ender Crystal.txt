The ender crystals are objects in Minecraft: Story Mode that were used to heal the ender dragon.

Ender crystals emit purple glow. While healing the ender dragon, a purple translucent beam from the crystal leads to it. Unlike in Minecraft, those crystals were not located on bedrock.

When Soren first told Jesse about the ender dragon fight, he said that all four crystals were destroyed. In reality, the ender crystals are located in Ivor's basement in far lands.
