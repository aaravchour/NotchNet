The Eversource Crown is an item found exclusively in Minecraft: Story Mode and was worn by Benedict.

The Eversource Crown is put on an Eversource Chicken to distinguish it from regular chickens as they look the same. The crown does not give the Chicken's the power to lay Spawn Eggs like Eversource Chickens and is merely cosmetic.

It was revealed by Mevia that there were once numerous Eversource Crowns that were used by the Old Builders to help distinguish the Eversource Chickens from normal chickens.
The Eversource Crown is one of the longest special items to have remained in Jesse's inventory during the next three episodes after "Order Up!", with the longest special item being the enchanted flint and steel.
