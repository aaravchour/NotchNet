Mind-Control Chips are small redstone devices used by PAMA to control the Mind-Controlled Citizens and hostile mobs.

When activated, they are gray with a glowing red dot (presumably redstone) in the middle with small gray spikes that stick into the victims head. A deactivated Mind Control Chip's center is dark red in appearance and doesn't glow.

A sticky piston pushes a dispenser-looking block onto the victims head in order to chip them.
When a human/mob is chipped, the Mind-Control Chips will make them stronger, tougher and faster. They also change the eye color to red and allow PAMA to freely control their minds and memories. If a mind control chip is submerged in water, it will short out and detach.

According to Petra/Lukas, their "chipping" made them become one with PAMA, sharing every piece of information with everybody else who was chipped. Their experience was described as "a fuzzy dream".
Entities wearing the Mind Control Chips can be hacked using the Mind-Control Headset, which changes the red eyes into a blue color.
When Jesse removes the Redstone Heart from PAMA's core, all Mind Control Chips are destroyed, or at least deactivated, as Petra/Lukas was seen wearing one despite being in control of themselves.
