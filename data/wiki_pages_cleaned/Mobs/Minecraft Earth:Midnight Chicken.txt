A midnight chicken was a passive mob and a dark-colored variant of the chicken found in Minecraft Earth.

Midnight chickens were a dark-colored variant of the chicken. Their plumage was dark-bluish in color, making it reminiscent of coal or obsidian. Their beak was dark in color with a gray stripe running across it. They also possessed dark-colored legs.

Midnight chickens had the same AI behavior as ordinary chickens. They wandered aimlessly, avoiding lava and cliffs that were enough to cause fall damage.

Midnight chickens were a rare mob drop from chicken tappables, with a 4.6% chance to get one. They were also obtainable as a reward in Season 17.

When killed, midnight chickens dropped:

0-2 Feather
1 Raw Chicken (Cooked Chicken if killed while on fire)

Midnight chickens were featured in the Season 3 prize map. The quest to get them was "Get a cluckshroom to lay 3 mushrooms on a buildplate."
Midnight chickens had a similar look to the Ayam Cemani chicken breed.
