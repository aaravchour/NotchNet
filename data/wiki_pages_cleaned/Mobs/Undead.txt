Undead, by definition, refers to an entity that is deceased, but still animate.

Within Minecraft, it refers to an in-game category of mobs that share the following characteristics:

Are damaged by Instant Health and healed by Instant Damage;
Are not affected by Regeneration and Poison;
Take extra damage from Smite;
Do not take drowning damage (husks and regular zombies turn into regular zombies and drowned, respectively);
Are not targeted by the wither.
Causes an armadillo to hide in their shells.
Some (but not all) undead mobs also possess these characteristics:

Are hostile to the player;
Catch fire under sunlight.

Despite the giant being an oversized variant of the zombie, it's not considered an undead mob.
Despite their ghost-like appearance, ghasts are not considered an undead mob. However, they are never targeted deliberately by the Wither boss.
The Zoglin is the only undead mob that is capable of attacking other undead mobs, and the only one that does not spawn naturally.
