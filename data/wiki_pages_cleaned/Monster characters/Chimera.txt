The chimera is a mythological monster, he is part lion and snake creature. He gives the teams the challenge of beating him in theatrical performances with two dryads.

The Chimera has a yellow-tan body with a dark brown curly mane, brown and yellow eyes, a white muzzle, and a scaly green serpent tail.

The Chimera is dramatic and spirited creature with a passion for acting. He likes "stagecraft" in the Minecraft Mini-Series.

Despite the origins of the chimera in Greek mythology (Chmaira referring to a she-goat) the Chimera only has a lion body and snake tail.
The Chimera in the Minecraft Mini-Series is based on the "Chimera" from Matel which in turn was based on a texture for the ocelot in the Greek Mythology Mash-up pack.
