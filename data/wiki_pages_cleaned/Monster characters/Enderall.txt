The enderall is a hostile and more powerful variant of the enderman in Minecraft Mini-Series. It first appeared in episode 5 in the Ender Cave on Scatter Island.

The enderall has telliporting abilities like an enderman along with the ability to suction mobs, items, and lightweight blocks (such as ladders) into it's portal-like mouth. It can also launch blocks or items it sucked in, back out as a ranged attack. It has a purple weak spot on it's back and drops ender pearls when killed.

The enderall is a big humanoid monster resembling endermen. It's black with a glowing purple portal-like mouth with black tooth-like spikes, glowing purple eyes, and a glowing purple streak on it's back.

The enderall was seen killing endermen, showing that it's hostile even with other related mobs similar to a zoglin.
The enderall was based on a minifigure by Matel which is based on a skin with the same name in the "Campfire Tales" skin pack.
