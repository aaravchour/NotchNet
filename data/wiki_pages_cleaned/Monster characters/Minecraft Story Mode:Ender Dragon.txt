The ender dragon was a boss mob which inhabited The End that appeared only in Minecraft: Story Mode - Season One and was hostile to anyone who came to the dimension. It was killed by the Old Order of the Stone.

The ender dragon in Story Mode looks similar to its base game counterpart with the difference of having a model with added details to the edges, giving it some slightly rounded features rather than a flat square model the base game dragon uses. It also has brighter grey back spikes, with the main larger three on its body having some edges.

The ender dragon had the ability to fly, shoot acid charges from its mouth and spew acid at its victims. It could also be continuously healed by the ender crystals.
