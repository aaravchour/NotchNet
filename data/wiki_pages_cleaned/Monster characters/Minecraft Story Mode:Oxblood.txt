Oxblood is a "guest" of the Sunshine Institute and character in Minecraft: Story Mode Season 2. He first appeared in "Jailhouse Block" and is voiced by Gregg Berger.

Oxblood is a strange and unique character in appearance as he has red skin, black facial hair, and different-sized black curved horns. His model is also larger and thicker than the normal player. He has a black monobrow and pupils. His overall appearance resembles that of Hellboy.

Oxblood is rough and grumpy towards strangers and the "associates" of the Sunshine Institute, but is seen to be loving and caring towards his pet mooshroom, Geoff.

It was confirmed that Oxblood's appearance was based off of the Dark Horse Comics character, Hellboy.
