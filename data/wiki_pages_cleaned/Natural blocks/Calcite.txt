Calcite is a carbonate mineral block.

Calcite drops as an item if mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

Calcite generates naturally as part of the structure of amethyst geodes, between the smooth basalt and block of amethyst layers. It also generates in the stony peaks in strips.

Calcite is currently used only for construction and decoration.
