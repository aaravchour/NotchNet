Cobblestone is a common block, obtained from mining stone. It is mainly used for crafting or as a building block.

Cobblestone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Its hardness is greater than stone so it requires more time to break, especially with anything other than a pickaxe.

Cobblestone is dropped by stone when mined without Silk Touch, and also by infested cobblestone when mined with Silk Touch. 

Cobblestone occurs naturally in monster rooms, jungle pyramids, pillager outposts, ocean ruins, strongholds, plains, taiga and snowy plains villages, woodland mansions, and trail ruins.
In Java Edition, a single block of cobblestone always generates at the coordinates of (8, -61, 8) at the center of the void start platform, in Superflat worlds created with the Void biome preset.

When water and flowing lava come into contact, the flowing lava is replaced by cobblestone; this is how cobblestone can be generated renewablely. However, if the lava flows on top of the water from above, stone is created instead. Non-flowing lava (a lava source block) turns into obsidian upon contact with water, thus the requirement of flowing lava.

Cobblestone can be used as basic building block, as it is blast resistant and extremely common.

Silverfish can enter and hide in cobblestone, creating an infested block.
