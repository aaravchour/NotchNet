Cocoa beans are items obtained from cocoa pods and are used to plant them, as well as to craft brown dye and cookies.
Cocoa pods are bonemealable plants placed on jungle log sides that grow cocoa beans, and can be found naturally in jungles.

In Java Edition, cocoa beans are only obtained through the natural generation of cocoa pods, while in Bedrock Edition, they can also be gotten in bonus chests, from fishing inside the jungle, bamboo jungle, and sparse jungle biomes and during trading with a wandering trader.
Cocoa beans come from cocoa pods, which are found on the trunks of normal-sized naturally-generated jungle trees in jungle, bamboo jungles, and sparse jungle temperate biomes.
Cocoa pods can be mined with any item, but axes are the quickest. In Java Edition, fully grown cocoa pods drop 3 cocoa beans, while in Bedrock Edition, they drop 3 - 4 cocoa beans. Using a tool enchanted with Fortune does not increase the amount of cocoa beans dropped.

The block itself can be obtained by inventory editing or add-ons in Bedrock Edition.
From one to two cocoa beans can be found in 40% of bonus chests in Bedrock Edition.

Cocoa beans can be obtained from fishing in a jungle in Bedrock Edition.
Wandering traders may sell 3 cocoa beans for an emerald during a trading in Bedrock Edition.

Placing cocoa beans on the side of a jungle log plants a new cocoa pod. The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on jungle logs, jungle wood, stripped jungle logs and stripped jungle wood.

Cocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a random tick, giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. Bone meal can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage. Cocoa pods burst and drop their beans when struck by flowing water, pushed by a piston or if their log or wood are removed by any means.

Placing cocoa beans into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. In Bedrock Edition, cocoa beans are accepted as a direct substitute of brown dye in many recipes.

Issues relating to "Cocoa Beans" or "Cocoa Pod" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

Cocoa pods have a different hitbox for each size; however, the top is always 0.25 blocks below the top of the log it is on.
If a cocoa pod grows while the player is standing next to it, the player is forced into the appropriate form of suffocation prevention depending on available space.
In Bedrock Edition, the pixels on top of the fully grown pod are 8/7 the size of those on the side.
