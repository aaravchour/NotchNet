Deepslate is a block found deep underground in the Overworld that functions similarly to stone, but is significantly more difficult to break.

Deepslate can only be obtained by mining it using a pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment, otherwise it drops cobbled deepslate. If broken using any other tool, it drops nothing. The breaking time for deepslate is twice the time for stone.

Deepslate makes up the majority of the solid blocks generated below Y=0 in the Overworld. Stone is gradually replaced from Y=8 to Y=0 until it is completely replaced by deepslate.
Deepslate also generates in ancient cities.

If a world generated before Caves & Cliffs: Part II is loaded after the update, the bedrock layer between Y=0 and Y=4 is replaced with deepslate.

On ancient_city/city_center/city_center_2, they generate a furnace with 24 deepslate inside of it.

Deepslate can be smelted from cobbled deepslate.

Deepslate can be placed in three orientations, similarly to logs. Silverfish can enter and hide in deepslate, creating an infested block.

Deepslate can be placed under note blocks to produce the "bass drum" sound.

According to Brandon Pearce, the reason for changing the name "grimstone" to "deepslate" was because the word "grim" had too many connotations related to a negative feeling and therefore did not accurately describe what the block is actually like. The name "deepslate" was eventually chosen because of its location within the world and to more accurately represent that it is a type of slate.
Similar to stone, the orientation of the texture varies depending on the coordinates.
