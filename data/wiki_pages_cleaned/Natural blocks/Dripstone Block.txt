The dripstone block is a rock block that allows pointed dripstone to grow beneath it.

Dripstone blocks require a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. It can be blown up by TNT, in which case it also drops itself.

Dripstone blocks can be found in dripstone caves. They can generate on the floor, the ceiling, as stalactites, stalagmites, or stalagnates (joined stalactite and stalagmite). They can generate underwater.

In Bedrock Edition, journeyman-level stone mason villagers have a 14 chance to sell 4 dripstone blocks for one emerald as part of their trades.

Dripstone blocks are used primarily for decoration.

If a stalactite is hanging from a dripstone block with a water source above, it will slowly grow both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below.
