Muddy mangrove roots are a decorative variant of mangrove roots.

Muddy mangrove roots can be broken by hand, but using a shovel speeds up the process. Muddy mangrove roots drop themselves when broken with any tool.

Muddy mangrove roots naturally generate in mangrove swamps where mud blocks intersect with normal mangrove roots at the bottom of mangrove trees.

When a mangrove propagule grows into a tree, if the tree roots intersect with nearby mud blocks, those mud blocks are converted into muddy mangrove roots.
