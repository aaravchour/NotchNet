A sculk catalyst is a block that converts blocks around it to blocks in the sculk family (except for more sculk catalysts) when a mob that drops experience dies nearby.

Sculk catalysts are generated within the deep dark biome.

A warden drops a single sculk catalyst upon death, unaffected by Looting.

Sculk catalysts can be mined with any tool, but hoes are the quickest. It drops 5 experience and no item if mined without Silk Touch. It drops itself if mined with any Silk Touch tool.

If a mob dies near a sculk catalyst, it can cause a sculk bloom. The catalyst's texture will react, causing a blooming animation. The sculk bloom produces sculk blocks, sculk veins, and sculk shriekers. These blocks can be used as decoration or harvested for experience. The sculk bloom also produces sculk sensors, which are useful in redstone contraptions.
For more information, see Sculk Growth.

Sculk catalysts emit a light level of 6.
