A zombified piglin (formerly named Zombie Pigman) is a neutral undead variant of the piglin that inhabits the Nether. Zombified piglins normally ignore players, but if one is attacked, it and all zombified piglins in the vicinity become enraged and attack the aggressor with their golden swords.

Zombified piglins can spawn in nether wastes, crimson forests, nether portals, and from pigs struck by lightning or from piglins or piglin brutes in the Overworld or in the End. They have a 5% chance of spawning as baby zombified piglins. Zombified piglins do not spawn on top of nether wart blocks. Like other naturally fireproof mobs, they can spawn on magma blocks.
A baby zombified piglin has a chance of spawning as a chicken jockey in Java Edition. An adult zombified piglin can also spawn riding a Strider above lava, holding a warped fungus on a stick.
All zombified piglins spawn with a golden sword, which has up to 25% chance of being enchanted in Normal or Hard modes. This chance varies depending on the regional difficulty. The sword's enchantment is from 5 to 23 levels.
On Halloween (October 31), zombified piglins have a 22.5% chance of spawning with a carved pumpkin or a 2.5% chance of spawning with a jack o'lantern equipped as headgear. This is not dropped, even if killed with Looting.

Zombified piglins spawn in groups of 4 / 2-4 in the Nether at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than nether wart block. They spawn most commonly in nether wastes, frequently in nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding striders in lava oceans.

When a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a random tick, there is a chance of 12000 (0.05%) on Easy, 11000 (0.1%) on Normal and 32000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin. 
In Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.
In Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing). Neither slabs nor lighting prevents this. "Portal ticking" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.
Zombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world. 
Zombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals.

A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig. If the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.

A piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or the End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds. When piglins wielding crossbows zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins. When baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn. When piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.
The newly zombified piglin gets the Nausea effect for 10 seconds. This is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.
A zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified.
Baby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey.
If a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.

01 rotten flesh. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.
01 gold nuggets. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.
1 gold ingot (2.5% chance) if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry. The chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.
There is an 8.5% or 25% chance to drop their original weapon if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry. The chance is increased by 1% or 5% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5% or 40% with Looting III. The death animation does not include the weapon if it was dropped.
golden sword (sometimes enchanted)
golden axe if zombified from a piglin brute
crossbow if zombified from a piglin
warped fungus on a stick if spawned riding a strider
After a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops any acquired armor and held weapons upon death.
5 for adults or 12 for babies if killed by a player or a tamed wolf. As of 1.21.5, zombified piglins no longer drop XP if killed indirectly while in an angered state.
An additional 13 is dropped if it does not drop its golden sword upon death.

Zombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle. They move at 2.28 m/s and are immune to fire and lava. When provoked, their speed increases to 3.38 m/s or faster for babies.
In Java Edition, like zombies, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty. 
In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55% or 25% of zombified piglins pick up any armor pieces and swords better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed. This also prevents them from despawning. 
Zombified piglins may pick up an illager banner next to it as pillagers do.
Zombified piglins try to destroy any turtle eggs they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically in Bedrock Edition), not counting the block they are standing in. When a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it. However, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.
Zombified piglins avoid walking near magma blocks and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high. If a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them. If a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.
Zombified piglins do not retreat from zoglins, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires. Zoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.
Zombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins. They also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.
Villagers and wandering traders run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders. In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close. Zombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked, which can happen when a piglin with a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.  Zombified piglins will not become aggressive if a player attacks and/or kills a regular piglin.
Iron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem. A zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.

Undead, they are:

Damaged by the status effect Instant Health and healed by the status effect Instant Damage. Throwing an instant damage splash potion does not anger them, since it heals them.
Unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.
Ignored by the wither and affected by Smite.
Unable to swim in water, but do not drown.

Zombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 672267 to 11122111 area or a 20-block radius centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except goats and ghasts) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit. They make an aggressive sound when angered. In addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked (similar to zombies and which can rarely include actual zombies). This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, whether its accidentally or purposefully, which includes deflected ghast fireballs, sweep attacks, snowballs and eggs, fireworks shot from crossbows, TNT, or a skeleton arrow. Arrows shot from dispensers or bed explosions don't provoke zombified piglins.
Duration: A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks), and has a direct line of sight with the player. However, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return neutral after a "forgiveness timer" expires. In Java Edition, this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds, whereas in Bedrock Edition it is always 25 seconds. The forgiveness timer does not advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks. Therefore, if the player enters a nether portal and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded). A player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers is true. 
A hostile zombified piglin can also "sound an alarm", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 672267 to 11122111 area  or 20-block radius. A hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 46 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers. They pursue players even if they have the Invisibility effect.
In Bedrock Edition, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.
Hostile zombified piglins have slightly different path finding than when they are neutral. For example, they would fall off edges that would cause them fall damage in attempt to reach the attacker where most other mobs would otherwise not do.
When a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.
Unlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack villagers and wandering traders.
If caught in the Nether with few items or no gold armor, staying near zombified piglins is a good strategy in Java edition. Aggravated piglins will be too afraid to approach the player, and any nearby skeletons shooting at the player will be quickly killed by the zombified piglins.  They do not become angry at the player if a mob hits them while trying to attack the player, though they have done so in versions of Pocket Edition.

The pre-Texture Update zombie pigman texture file has "THX XAPHOBIA" written on the unused section as a credit by Notch to the skin's original creator.
Deaths of hostile zombified piglins always register as kills by the player they are targeting, regardless of whether that player ever touched that zombified piglin.
The zombified piglin's angry sound is played twice the speed of the original sound file in the game.
Applying the Classic Texture Pack changes the zombified piglin's model and texture back to a zombie pigman.
There is a glitch where the zombified piglin texture appears as the zombie pigman even without the Classic Texture Pack.
In Minecraft Legends, Piglins don't zombify in the Overworld because they breathe in Nether Wart spores.
In the Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode Girl in the Flower Dress, Jemma Simmons mentions a zombified piglin (known as zombie pigman at the time) as the "rather nasty mob" in one of the episode's fictional character's "runs" in Minecraft.
In the 15 Year map, the Zombified Piglin uses the Piglin's sound files as opposed to its own.
In Minecraft: Story Mode, Zombified Piglins are just pigmen and are, according to episode eight, apparently always staring at players.
