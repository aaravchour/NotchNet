The torch (burnt-out) is a joke feature introduced exclusively in Java Edition 2.0. After a normal torch burns out, the burnt-out torch appears.

A burnt-out torch breaks instantly and drops itself when broken using anything. Tools do not lose durability when used to break burnt-out torches.

When the torch is placed it will, when it is random ticked, turn into a burnt-out torch.

Burnt-out torches can be re-lit with flint and steel, turning them back into regular torches.

Torch (burnt-out) blocks are an unsupported item due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed.
