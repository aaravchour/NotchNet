Torches are non-solid blocks that emit light.
Soul torches are turquoise variants crafted with the addition of soul soil or soul sand.

Torches can be found generated among the supports in a mineshaft's corridors, as part of village lamp posts and most houses, in various rooms in strongholds, in the basements of igloos, in woodland mansions, and atop pillager outposts. Torches also generate around bonus chests if each side has a block at the same height around it. In the End, four torches generate as part of the exit portal, around the second bedrock block from the top. Torches also generate in ancient cities.

Whenever the ender dragon dies or is re-summoned using end crystals, the four torches on the exit portal regenerate. If the original torches are still in position, then they drop as items, while the new torches take their place.

Torches can be broken instantly using anything, and drop themselves as an item.
A torch is removed and drops itself as an item if:

Its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed
Water or lava flows into its space
A piston pushes it or moves a block into its space

Torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some blocks require sneaking. Being non-solid, torches have no collision box. More information about placement can be found at Opacity/Placement.
Gravity-affected blocks like sand and gravel will not start falling if the space immediately beneath is occupied by a torch. Falling blocks break if they fall onto a solid block with a torch above it. If there is an air block under the torch, the falling blocks fall through the torch onto the surface below.

Torches give off a light level of 14. Torches also melt snow layers within 2 blocks and ice within 3 blocks (taxicab distance).
Soul torches give off a light level of 10. Due to their lower light level, soul torches do not melt snow or ice.

Soul torches repel piglins.
