Narrator is a character in the official Minecraft YouTube channel voiced by Matthew Holness.
He narrated the series How We Make Minecraft and then co-hosted The Secrets of Minecraft and Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes with MARILLA from Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft.

Narrator uses a skin made in the Bedrock Edition's Character creator. Starting with the Alex skin, his base is the Slender Skin with Cool Birch color, the hair is Short Slick colored Dark Brown, the eyes are Steely Stare colored Alex Green, the top is the Tuxedo Waistcoat, and the bottom is Alex's Pants.

Narrator is calm, sarcastic, false factual, and somewhat egotistical.

The description card on Minecraft's YouTube channel has him as "Untelligent", [sic] "Self-proclaimed Minecraft expert", etc. This changes each episode.
Narrator allegedly married Mobbo, though he doesn't remember it.
He believes that "MARILLA was created a few thousand years before rocks were invented".
He supposedly met his end at the hands of the Warden by the orders of Mobbo.
Narrator is canonically divorced from his ex-husband, Jonathan Minecraft.
He claims to have been almost cast in Avengers Endgame, playing a character Marilla refers to as Cowardly British Man.
