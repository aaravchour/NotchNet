Nizzotch is a YouTube channel that was used by Markus Persson (Notch) to share videos of Minecraft's development. Originally created on August 11, 2008, 39 videos (38 public and 1 unlisted) were uploaded to the channel between August 11, 2008, and August 30, 2011, most of them pertaining to Minecraft, with a few others of some of Notch's other games.
Notch stopped using the channel for Minecraft content after the release of the Halloween Update, but would upload more Minecraft progress videos to another channel named mojnotch and to the official Minecraft YouTube channel. He also had a now-deleted channel for 0x10c videos and has an additional channel he still occasionally uses for gaming videos, both named Markus Persson.
All of the videos on the Nizzotch channel were blocked using a copyright claim filed by Notch after he left Mojang, making them unviewable on the original channel.
