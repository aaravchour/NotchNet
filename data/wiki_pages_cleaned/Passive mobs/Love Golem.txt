The love golem was a utility mob present in the April Fool's Love and Hugs Update. It was a manifestation of the villager's love.

Love golems spawn under normal iron golem spawning conditions. They could also be created by the player with the same blocks.

Love golems, despite being a reskinned iron golem, were passive and didn't attack monsters nor players.
