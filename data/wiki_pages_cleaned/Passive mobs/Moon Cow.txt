A moon cow is a variant of a cow that only spawns on the Moon. They function similarly to the cow, except they walk backwards and wear glass on their heads.

Moon cows spawn on the surface of cheese blocks in the the Moon dimension.

An adult moon cow drops:

1-3 glass bottles, average of 2.
0-2 cheese, average of 1.
0-1 bones, 50%.
0-1 glass, 10%. Glass can drop only on a player kill.
Killing a calf yields no items nor experience.

A moon cow follows a player who holds wheat but stops following if separated from the player by at least six blocks.
Adult moon cows enter love mode and pair off to create calves after they are given wheat, granting the player one to seven experience orbs. The parent cows have a cooldown of five minutes before they can breed again and the growth of calves can be accelerated using wheat; each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%. 
Baby moon cows take 20 minutes to grow up and follow adult cows, preferring them instead of a player holding wheat. The moon calf that results from breeding attempts to go to the nearest available block to its parent, even if no path can be found. A moon calf pathfinds to other adult cows if it is separated from its parent by more than 24 blocks. Earthen calves seem to also follow moon cows, but moon calves don't seem to follow earthen cows.

Like regular cows, moon cows can be fed air to turn them into balloon cows and go back to the Earth. The glass bottles dropped by them allow the player to craft new air if they run out of it. After reaching Y=689, the cow explodes with a firework blast and gives the player Nausea II and Levitation II for 20 seconds.

Moon cows use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Moon cows walking backwards is a reference to the dance move moonwalk, where through a visual trick a dancer appears to walk backwards.
Moon cows have their own spawn egg, but they're only obtainable through commands or the spawn_egg_chance Vote.
Moon cows are unable to breed when the condition that allows craftable air blocks is enabled, as they will be mounted instead of fed when right clicked with wheat.
