An azalea tree is a rare tree that can generate above a lush cave biome, marking the biome's presence above ground. They extend their roots underground into the cave beneath.

Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a lush cave, including in biomes that are not grassy or underground. Their roots consist of rooted dirt and hanging roots that reach all the way down to the lush cave at cavern systems such as ravines and abandoned mineshafts. The trees appear most commonly at the surface, but they can also generate inside caves given that there is enough room.

Using bone meal on an azalea or flowering azalea eventually grows an azalea tree, replacing the block below where the azalea was grown with a single rooted dirt. It does not need to be over a lush caves biome, instead working in any biome like saplings.
