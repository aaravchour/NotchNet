A melon slice is a food item that can be eaten by the player.

Melon slices can be obtained by breaking (harvesting) melons using any tool or by hand. Axes, followed by swords, are the fastest tools for harvesting melons.  A melon drops 37 melon slices, when broken; by hand, using a tool, or after being broken by the movement of a piston, with an average of 4.64 slices per melon.
Breaking a melon with a tool enchanted with Fortune increases the potential number of drops by 1 slice per level, up to a maximum of 9 slices.

To eat a melon slice, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 1.2 hunger 
saturation.

Placing a melon slice into a composter has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
