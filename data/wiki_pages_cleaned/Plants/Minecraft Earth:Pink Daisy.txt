The Pink Daisy was an item in Minecraft Earth. Moolips had pink daisies growing on their backs, and were able to be sheared to get the item. Moolips also planted them just by walking around.

Pink daisies were obtainable from grass or marsh tappables.

A moolip also dropped one pink daisy when sheared.
In Adventures, a moolip planted pink daisies and other pink flowers while walking.
