A pitcher plant is a plant that grows from a pitcher pod.

When a pitcher pod grows into its final stage, it becomes a pitcher plant.

Pitcher plants can be broken instantly with any item or by hand.
Pitcher plants also break if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

A pitcher plant can be crafted into 2 cyan dye.
