Shrubs (known as Ferns, in Bedrock Edition) are variants of grass that do not generate naturally and are currently only obtainable in Legacy Console Edition via the creative inventory and in Bedrock Edition via commands. They have the same characteristics as grass and ferns.

When broken normally, shrubs have a 18 chance of dropping wheat seeds, due to being a type of grass. This drop rate is affected by Fortune like normal grass as well. Shrubs can be obtained as an item using shears.

In Java Edition, the shrub uses the texture of dead bushes. The only visual difference between the shrub and the dead bush is that the shrub appears shorter, or sunk into the ground by 1 pixel.
In Bedrock Edition, the shrub uses the texture of grass.
