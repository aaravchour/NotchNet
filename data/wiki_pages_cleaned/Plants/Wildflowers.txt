Wildflowers are a decorative block similar to pink petals.

Unlike Pink Petals, Wildflowers consists of small yellow and white Flowers that look vaguely similar to dandelions and azure bluets.

Wildflowers can be broken instantly with any item or by hand.
Wildflowers also break if water or lava runs over its location, or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location.

Wildflowers generate naturally in birch forests, old growth birch forests and meadows.

Each time bone meal is applied to wildflowers, they drop a copy of themselves, similar to tall flowers.
Wildflowers also generate when bone meal is applied to a grass block in birch forests, old growth birch forests and meadows.

Wandering traders sometimes sell wildflowers for 1 emerald.

More than one wildflower can be placed on a block, similarly to other blocks such as pink petals, sea pickles and candles. Up to four wildflowers can be placed in a group on one block.

Bees can pollinate wildflowers like other flowers. They can also be bred using wildflowers. 

Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of wildflowers have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 2-3 bees.

Placing wildflowers into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
