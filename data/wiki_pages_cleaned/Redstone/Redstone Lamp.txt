A redstone lamp is a block that produces light when activated with a redstone signal.

Redstone lamps generate naturally in ancient cities.

A redstone lamp can be mined with any tool or by hand, dropping itself as an item.

A redstone lamp can be used to produce switchable light. 
Redstone lamps are redstone mechanisms and can be activated by:

An adjacent active power component, including above or below: for example, a redstone torch (except that a redstone torch does not activate a redstone lamp it is attached to), a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, etc.
An adjacent powered block (for example, an opaque block with an active redstone torch under it), including above or below
A powered redstone comparator or redstone repeater facing the redstone lamp
Adjacent powered redstone dust configured to point at the redstone lamp (or on top of it) or directionless; a redstone lamp is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point away from it.
A redstone lamp activates instantly, but takes 2 redstone ticks to turn off (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag).
An active redstone lamp produces block light 15. An inactive redstone lamp produces no light.
A redstone lamp acts like an opaque block; it blocks sky light, mobs suffocate in it, and it conducts redstone power. It also allows mobs to spawn on them while it is unlit.

Issues relating to "Redstone Lamp" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

Multiple tiled redstone lamps produce a pattern that resembles the truncated square tiling t{4,4}.
Redstone lamps are transparent on maps.

Since lamps themselves are solid blocks, they power other lamps. This causes the cross-shaped patterns of lit lamps.

A glowing roof can be done by laying wire across the blocks, or lining the top of the lamps with redstone blocks. Floors and walls are also do-able. A glowing floor can be created by using "knight's move" shape underneath the floor with torches. A glowing wall uses wall-mounted torches that power blocks above them.
