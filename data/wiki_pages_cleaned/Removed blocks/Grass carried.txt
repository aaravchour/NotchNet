grass_carried was a block which was used for storing the item model for grass blocks.

grass_carried is only known to be obtainable through the use of inventory editors and other external tools. If placed in a world, the block can be mined instantly with any item, but it does not drop anything regardless of the method used.

grass_carried obviously highly resembles the actual grass block. However, there are two key differences between it and normal grass blocks:

The top texture is a noticeably different color, and in fact matches the side texture much more than normal grass blocks.
This is due to this block using a pre-tinted texture, whereas the normal grass block uses a grayscale texture with a constant tint.
While grass blocks use the dirt texture on the bottom, grass_carried uses the side texture on the bottom: 

Despite very closely resembling the grass block visually, grass_carried has notable functional differences from normal grass blocks:

It can be broken instantly.
It does not drop anything at all when broken.
It does not have an icon in the inventory.
It cannot be turned into farmland.
Blocks which require a dirt-like block below them to exist, such as flowers and sugar cane, cannot be placed on it.
Placing an opaque block on top on it does not gradually convert it to dirt.

grass_carried is a removed block and as such issues relating to it cannot be fixed.
