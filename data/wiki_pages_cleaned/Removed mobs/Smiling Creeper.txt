The smiling creeper was a "hostile" mob present in the April Fool's Love and Hugs Update.

Smiling creepers spawn under normal creeper spawning conditions.

A smiling creeper behaved like a normal creeper, except that the explosion of a smiling creeper did not break blocks or cause damage. Instead, the smiling creeper dropped poppies that the player could not pick up.
