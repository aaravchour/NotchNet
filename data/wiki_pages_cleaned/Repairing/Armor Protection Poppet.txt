The Armor Protection Poppet is a tool from the Witchery mod. This tool is used to protect a bound player's armor from breaking. Right before an armor piece would break, its durability will be restored. The poppet will be destroyed after a single use (one armor piece restored). For a poppet to properly function, it must first be bound to a player. This can be done by combining a creature/player's taglocks with the poppet in a crafting table. Taglocks can be obtained by using the Taglock Kit. For the poppet to work, it must be in a player's inventory or in a Poppet Shelf.
Wearing a full suit of Witch Hunter armor will disallow the player from using this poppet.
