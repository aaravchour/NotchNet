The Auto-Anvil has 2 input slots, 1 output slot, and 3 display elements: a tank and 2 bars. 

Tank: Displays stored Mob Essence.
Energy bar: Displays stored EU or MJ up to a maximum of 4,000 EU or 1,600 MJ.
Progress bar: Displays progress of item being being repaired.
To fix an item of any material, you must put the item in 1 of the 2 top slots, and the material the item is made of in the other. This action requires 400mB of Mob Essence and 4,000 EU or 1,600 MJ.

If the player shift-clicks a stack of materials into the second input slot, it will be lost and replaced with only 1 instance of that material.
