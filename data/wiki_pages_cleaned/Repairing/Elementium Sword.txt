The Elementium Sword is a weapon added by the Botania mod. It can use Mana from a Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 60 Mana per point of durability.  
If the player wielding this sword is attacked, there's an 5% chance to spawn a Pixie going after the attacker. The chance stacks additively with worn armor and accessories. In addition, all pixies spawned by a wielder of this sword will have their attack damage increased by 2.
