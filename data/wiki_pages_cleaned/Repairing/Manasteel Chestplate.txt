The Manasteel Chestplate is an armor piece added by Botania. It can use Mana from a Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 70 Mana per point of durability. 
If the player is wearing a complete set of Manasteel armor, they will gain the Mana Affinity set bonus, decreasing the Mana cost on all Mana-using tools and rods by 10%.
Phantom Ink can be applied to this item in the crafting grid to turn it invisible.
