The Manasteel Pickaxe is a tool added by the Botania mod. It uses Mana from Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 60 Mana per point of durability. This tool will place a torch from the player's inventory when right clicked on a surface.
