The Manasteel Shovel is a tool added by Botania. It uses Mana from a Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 60 Mana per point of durability.
When used on Dirt or Grass Blocks, the block will turn into a Grass Path; when used on a Grass Path, it will turn into Farmland.
