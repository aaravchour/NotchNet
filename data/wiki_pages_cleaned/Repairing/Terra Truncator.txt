The Terra Truncator is a tool added by Botania.  It uses Mana from Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 100 Mana per point of durability.  
When this axe is used to break a log or leaf block, it will start breaking all logs and leaves connected either directly or through at most 2 leaf blocks, up to a 63x63x63 area centered on the broken block. Each block broken uses 1 durability.
If the user is sneaking or an active Stone of Temperance is present in the player's inventory, this abillity will be suppressed.
Just like the Manasteel Axe, right clicking on dirt with the tool will plant a sapling from the player's inventory.
