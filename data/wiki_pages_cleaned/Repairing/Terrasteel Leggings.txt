The Terrasteel Leggings are an armor piece added by Botania. It can use Mana from a Mana Tablet or any other Mana providing item in the player's inventory to prevent item damage or repair itself, using 70 Mana per point of durability. In addition to diamond level protection, it provides 0.3 knockback resistance.
If the player is wearing a complete set of Terrasteel armor, they will gain the Will of the Ancients set bonus:

Passive generation of 1 Mana per tick,
20% decrease of Mana cost on all Mana-using tools and rods,
Passive regeneration of 2 health every 4 seconds if their hunger bar isn't full,
Effects of all Wills applied to the worn Terrasteel Helmet.

This recipe preserves enchantments on the used leggings.
