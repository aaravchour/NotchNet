Stronghold large rooms can have up to four exits (including the entrance to the room) and come in four variants: empty room, stone pillar room, fountain room and storeroom. Therefore, each variant will be shown in the build.

NOTICE: Since there is multiple exits possible, the build will show multiple variants as "Layer 2a" and "Layer 2b." "a" is for no entrance, "b" for wooden doors, "c" for iron doors, "d" for iron bars, and "e" for a plain entrance. The sides can be mixed and matched.

The second floor contains a single loot chest, and can be accessed by ladders placed against one side of the wall. For simplicity's sake, the entrances is not shown.
