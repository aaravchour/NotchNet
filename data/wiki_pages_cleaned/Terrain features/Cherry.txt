Cherry blossom trees are found in cherry groves. Cherry blossoms have distinct pink leaves and curved branches. They also have a unique petal falling particle effect. 

These items can be obtained from cherry:

Cherry Leaves (harvested with shears)
Cherry Log (harvested with any tool including hands)
Cherry Planks (crafted from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
Cherry Sapling (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Stick (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Stripped Cherry Log (created by using an axe on a log)
Bee Nest

Cherry saplings can be planted on:

Dirt
Grass Block
Coarse Dirt
Podzol
Mycelium
Rooted Dirt
Moss Block
Farmland
Mud
Muddy Mangrove Roots
A cherry tree requires a 55 area of unobstructed space 8 blocks above its sapling to grow (9 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow). Their growth is not hindered by logs, leaves or saplings.

The cherry tree naturally generates in cherry grove.
