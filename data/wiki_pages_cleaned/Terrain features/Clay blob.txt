Clay blobs were a terrain feature that existed as a way for clay blocks to generate naturally.

Clay blobs would generate extremely similarly to conventional ore blobs (potentially even to the extent of being impacted by the same precision loss bugs), replacing sand blocks in beaches. Whether they would generate in deserts as well is unknown.
