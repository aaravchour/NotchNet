A dark oak tree is a variant of the oak tree with a thick trunk. They are found in the dark forest biome.

Dark oak trees generate with thick 22 trunks. Dirt blocks appear under the trunk if generated on a steep cliff. Dark oak trees nearly always generate with irregular logs connected to the trunk  these represent large branches.
Dark oak trees with trunks consisting of 11 dark oak logs, instead of 22, can be found in two types of rooms in woodland mansions: the tree chopping room, and the nature room. These are not generated elsewhere in the world, and cannot be grown from saplings.

Dark oaks spawn naturally only in the Dark Forest biome. A dark oak always generates with dirt under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over air or water blocks.

These items can be obtained from all variants of dark oak:

Apple (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Dark Oak Leaves (harvested with shears)
Dark Oak Log (harvested with any tool including hands)
Dark Oak Planks (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
Dark Oak Sapling (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Stripped Dark Oak Log (created by using an axe on a log)
Vines (harvested with shears from a dying tree)
Stick (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)

Dark oak saplings can be planted on:

Dirt
Grass Block
Coarse Dirt
Podzol
Mycelium
Rooted Dirt
Moss Block
Farmland
Mud
Muddy Mangrove Roots
Growing these trees requires four dark oak saplings arranged in a 22 grid; they do not grow if planted individually. Dark oak trees grow at a much faster rate than most other trees. They require a 33 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. Additionally, dark oak trees require 55 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (saplings planted in a 22 hole 1 block deep still grow).

                                                                            
In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, dark oaks can generate as a dying tree. Dying dark oaks generate naturally, and can be grown from normal saplings. A dying dark oak has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.
