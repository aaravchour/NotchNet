Desert wells are features made of sandstone.

Desert wells generate in desert biomes. They have a 11000 or 1500 chance to be generated in the given chunk. It is possible for a well to generate around a cactus. The well is considered a feature rather than a structure, and therefore it generates with the "Generate Structures" option disabled.

Desert wells are built of sandstone blocks and slabs with a water source inside. Underneath the water source, there are some suspicious sand blocks that can be excavated using a brush to get various items.
