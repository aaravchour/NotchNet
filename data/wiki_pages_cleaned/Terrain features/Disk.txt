A disk is a feature consisting of a naturally generated roughly circular deposit of a soil-like block under or next to bodies of water.

Disks are generated at the Euclidean distance n (i.e. x2+y2=n2) from a given central block, creating a circular-looking pattern of the given block with a radius of n. They are commonly seen throughout rivers, shallow oceans, swamps and mangrove swamps.
