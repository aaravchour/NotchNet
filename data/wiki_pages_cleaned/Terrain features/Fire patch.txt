A fire patch is a feature that consists of fire or soul fire.

Fire patch generates only on netherrack if it is normal fire, while soul fire patch generates on soul soil.
In Bedrock Edition, fire patch feature generates in any biome in the Nether.
In Java Edition, normal fire patch generates also in any biome in the Nether. But soul fire patch cannot generate in Crimson Forest biome.
