A forest rock is a feature found throughout old growth taiga biomes.

A forest rock is a feature that represents a boulder, made entirely of mossy cobblestone. They can be found dotted around areas of the old growth taiga biomes at the surface.

Forest rocks represent fairly large rocks, varying in size and shape, and usually half-buried in the ground. Their shapes are overall similar, although some are smaller or larger depending on generation and whether they join with a nearby boulder. Each face tends to have a cross shape or square shape, possibly missing a corner or two.
