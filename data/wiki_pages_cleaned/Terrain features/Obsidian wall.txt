Obsidian walls were an experimental and short-lived debugging structure made of obsidian. They were introduced in a version Infdev released on February 27th, 2010 and were removed a short time later.

Obsidian walls would replace all solid blocks which had an X or Z coordinate of 0, and extend two blocks above the terrain. This formed a set of two walls for the two cardinal directions and would intersect at the center of the world. The obsidian walls would generate in every world.

In Infdev 20100227-1, The player would spawn at the point which the two walls intersect. The wall was always made of 2 block high obsidian which was placed on top of the existing terrain. From there, it would generate obsidian going all the way down to the bottom of the world replacing any stone, dirt, or grass blocks below it. The obsidian walls would also help the player to discover a brick pyramid, which was another generated structure in this version, introduced for testing structure generation and experimenting with the terrain generator's ability to handle large structures. Once the player spawns into a new world, turning left 45 degrees from the spawn point and walking straight in that direction, and reaching the end of the skybox, the player would find a brick pyramid.
