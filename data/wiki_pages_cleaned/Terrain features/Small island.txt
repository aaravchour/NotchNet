A small island (aka. end island) is roughly a hemispherical cluster of end stone blocks found within its respective biome.

Small islands are generated from Y=55 to Y=70 around outer islands. The probability that a small island tries to generate in each chunk is 114. It generates successfully when in small end islands biome or at a chunk where the noise value fits. In Java Edition, if it tries generate a small island in a chunk, there's an 14 probability to try to generate another small island in this chunk. The two islands often overlap with each other. In Bedrock Edition, if the the chunk's noise value fits, there's also a probability of 14 to re-generate another island, but at the exactly same position, which makes the two islands look like a single island. 
It also generates when an end gateway spawns on the outer island if the chunk does not provide any end stone.
