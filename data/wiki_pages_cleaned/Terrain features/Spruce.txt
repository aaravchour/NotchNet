A spruce and pine, grows from a spruce sapling and has growth patterns and requirements similar to birch trees, although they appear different. They are mainly found in the taiga biome, but they may also generate in windswept forest, snowy plains, snowy taiga, and old growth taiga biomes.

There are several different forms of these trees that may grow from any spruce saplings:

A spruce - common variant with a height between 5-12. The leaves tend to grow in discrete rows rather than the more spherical arrangement of oaks and birch trees. In Bedrock Edition, only this variant can be grown using saplings.
A pine - fairly tall variant of spruce trees that generate in a matchstick style, with only a few leaves at the top.
A mega spruce - larger variant of spruce that generates in the old growth spruce taiga which has a lot more leaves than the mega pine. In Bedrock Edition, only this variant can be grown using saplings.
A mega pine - larger variant of pine that generates in the old growth pine taiga These spruce trees have few leaves, concentrated at the top, and can be grown from spruce saplings arranged in a 22 square, with or without bone meal.

The spruce tree variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes:

In an amplified taiga or old growth taiga, some of the spruces generate with snow on them, just like in the other cold biomes.
When mega spruces grow, they convert any grass blocks, dirt, mycelium, coarse dirt, rooted dirt and moss blocks up to a radius of 6 blocks to podzol, centered on the south-eastern sapling.
Like birches, they do not grow branches. When height-constrained, the trunk height maximum is two less than the roof. The headroom of 9 blocks limits the tree to a trunk height of 7, which enables harvesting from ground level.

These items can be obtained from all variants of spruce.

Mushrooms (if present on a fallen log)
Spruce Leaves (harvested with shears)
Spruce Log (harvested with any tool including hands)
Spruce Planks (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
Spruce Sapling (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
Stripped Spruce Log (created by using an axe on a log)
Vines (harvested with shears from dying trees)
Stick (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)

Spruce saplings may be planted and grown on:

Dirt
Grass Block
Coarse Dirt
Podzol
Mycelium
Rooted Dirt
Moss Block
Farmland
Mud
Muddy Mangrove Roots
In order to grow a 22 tree (be it mega spruce, mega pine, mega jungle or dark oak), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. Bone meal can be used on any of the saplings. The largest mega spruces and mega pines reach 30 blocks tall.
11 spruces require a 55 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree and 1 level above (a sapling planted in a hole 2 blocks deep can still grow).
22 mega spruces require a 55 column of unobstructed space at least 14 blocks above the saplings to grow (15 blocks including the saplings themselves). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. A 33 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings).

                                                                            
In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.

A dying spruce and dying pine has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.

A fallen spruce may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 12 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.
A fallen spruce log has a length of 610 blocks, and the stump is never covered with vines.

Spruce leaves do not follow the foliage color rules that cause the trees to appear in different colors in different biomes. Spruce leaves are always the same color regardless of the biome.

In real life, spruce is a genus of trees known as Picea.
Even though real-life spruce trees are conifers and possess needles, the leaves on spruce trees in Minecraft is still called "spruce leaves".
