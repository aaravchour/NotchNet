Clocks are time-telling devices that display the current in-game position of the sun and the moon. Clocks only function properly in the Overworld.

Expert-level librarian villagers have a 13 (roughly 33.3%) chance to sell a single clock for 4 emeralds as part of their trades.
Expert-level librarian villagers have a 12 (50%) chance to sell a clock for 5 emeralds.

The clock dial consists of two halves, a day side and a night side. The dial spins clockwise slowly to indicate the time of day, corresponding to the sun or moon's actual position in the sky. The player is able to sleep a few seconds after the clock shows exactly dusk.
The dial always shows the current in-game time when in the Overworld, regardless of where it appears. This includes a player's hand, an inventory slot, a crafting grid, an item frame, or even as a dropped item. For a clock to be mounted on a wall, an item frame is required.
Because there is no day/night cycle in the Nether or the End, clocks do not work properly in these dimensions. Instead, the dial rotates rapidly and randomly in Java Edition or clockwise in Bedrock Edition, making them useless.

Piglins are attracted to clocks and run toward any clock on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.

Note: This video doesn't state that clocks can be found in shipwrecks or ruined portals because the video was released in an earlier version.

To generate its appearances, the clock combined 2 textures, one being the actual clock, and the other being the dial. 

The logic solely for mixing the two (as there is additional logic for moving the dial in a wobbly fashion that isn't pertinent here) is as follows:

This results in the item and dial sprites being mixed by fuchsia areas of the clock sprite, as well as being shaded by them (contrary to the popular belief that they were mixed solely on the two shades found on the vanilla sprite).
This allowed for the clock to be animated precisely, having 230 visually distinct frames, in an era where block and item sprites couldn't be animated individually without mods. The pre-rendered animated approach, used in 1.5 onwards, is far less precise, with only 64 different frames.

Due to an oversight with how assets were loaded however, the item sprite for clocks couldn't be overridden by texture packs (as they are set to always load from the vanilla gui/items.png atlas, stored in minecraft.jar, rather than the one of the currently active texture pack.

In Java Edition, a clock can be viewed under the item statistics page as long as one obtained a clock at some point.
In Java Edition, the default resource pack for the clock contains 64 individual frames, each frame lasting about 18.75 seconds in real time (375 ticks) (1350 seconds (22 minutes, 30 seconds) in Minecraft time).
When the time of day changes suddenly, such as after sleeping or when /time is used, the clock dial spins rapidly to catch up.
Although clocks do not function in the Nether or the End, the actual daylight cycle does continue.
