A milk bucket is a drink obtained from using a bucket on cows, mooshrooms and goats that can be consumed to clear all effects.

Milk buckets can be obtained from cows, mooshrooms, and goats by pressing use while looking at them with an empty bucket.

A milk bucket has a chance of dropping from a wandering trader, if the trader is killed while holding it.

Holding use with a milk bucket starts the drinking sound and animation. In Java Edition, the animation is shown only in first-person camera mode.
When consumed, milk immediately removes all status effects from the player. Fire is not a status effect; therefore, drinking milk doesn't extinguish a burning player.
The benefits of area status effects granted by beacons and conduit power are restored almost immediately in Bedrock Edition and after a few seconds in Java Edition.
