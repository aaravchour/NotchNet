This page lists the defenses in minecraft from weakest to strongest:

No defense
Dirt wall
Water moat
Stone wall
Cobblestone wall
Cobblestone generator wall
Lava moat
Water moat infested with guardians/pufferfish
Obsidian wall
Bedrock wall
Bedrock cube that goes to both build limits
Void moat
Chunk ban

In conclusion, the best base defense it to have a bedrock cube 8 block wide to prevent chorus fruit users to teleport, goes down to the build limit and have bubble columns to prevent ender pearls to land on top, surrounded with chunk ban hovering over the void.
