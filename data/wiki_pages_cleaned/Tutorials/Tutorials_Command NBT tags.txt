NBT tags can be specified for items and entities created with the /give and /summon commands. Each tag has the format <tagname>:<value> where <tagname> describes what it does, and <value> is what it applies. Multiple tags are separated by commas. (e.g. {CustomName:'"Bob"', Invisible:true). The contents of List tags are enclosed in square brackets [], while the contents of Compound tags are enclosed in curly brackets {}  note that the entire data tag is itself a Compound tag (All within a set of {}). Tag names are case-sensitive, and white space is ignored. Additionally, some tags which are either true or false are stored as Byte tags (Example: {NoAI:1b})
The player can quickly find data tags (NBT) without the use of external editors by using /data to figure out the data for each entity or block entity. See more about this in the article Commands/data.
See Entity format for the various NBT Tags that are saved for each entity. This page also contains basic information for each NBT Tag.
When None is used in a tag name that means that this tag can be put directly into the start of the dataTag.

These can be used in /give and /item commands as well as /clear. For commands such as /summon and /setblock, place them inside of a tag.
Example:
{id:"minecraft:stone",Count:3b, ..., tag:{Name:'{"text":"Name Here"}', ...}}
These tags can be used on any item.
