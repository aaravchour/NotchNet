A flying machine can be used for things other than flying. Currently, these things can be done with it:
Elevator. Build a vertical flying machine to work as an elevator.
Automated Lumberjack. Stick slime underneath the flying machine, then send it into a tree. It should then have wood logs stuck to the slime, meaning you can gather wood from the flying machine directly.
If there are any more uses you can think of, edit the page and add them in.
