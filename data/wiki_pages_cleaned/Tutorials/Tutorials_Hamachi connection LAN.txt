You can setup a Hamachi LAN which allows people in your Hamachi network to connect to your LAN server via Hamachi connection.

Get your friends to join your Hamachi network. (Network>Join an existing network...)

Create a single player Minecraft world
Hit Escape and Select the Open to LAN button
Set the options and open the LAN network
Distribute the 5 digit port number that will appear in the chat window to the other players; this can be done over Hamachi's chat window or another chat method.(#####)

Go to "Multiplayer" on the main menu and either click "Add a server" or "Direct connect".
Copy the host's IPv4 address (Click on their name in Hamachi and click "Copy IPv4 Address")
Paste the IP in to the server address box along with the 5 digit port number distributed by the host (#####). You should now have something like ##.###.##.###:##### as your IP. (If there are any letters in the IP, you have the IPv6 address. Copy the IPv4 address instead.)
Join the server.

Up to 5 free players, although you can host multiple Networks and have more players connect.
Have some problems with connection via 3G or 4G USB modem
Tip: Try disabling the firewall if you or your friend can't connect. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so keep on trying.

Radmin VPN
ZeroTier One
Ngrok (port-forwards / no program install needed)
Note: Never use these other than LAN connections, these might get you banned or kicked from servers.

In version 1.13.2 there has been a bug which causes your LAN IP to be incorrectly displayed and would look something like this:

0.0.0.0:#####The port number is technically correct, however the "0.0.0.0" part is incorrect.
In Hamachi, right click the big number near the t
Now, paste that in with the five-digit port number shown in Minecraft.
You should now have your game's IP: ##.###.##.###:#####.
