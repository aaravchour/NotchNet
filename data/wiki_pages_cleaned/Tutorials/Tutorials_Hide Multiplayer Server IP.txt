Are you worried about people seeing your multiplayer server IP while you are recording or streaming? Watch the video below, it will teach you how to hide your server IP's without any mods:

In this tutorial, you edit your hosts file to add a hostname to an IP address. This allows you to record a video with no IP address showing and no one is able to look it up, unless they have your hosts file.

In windows, the hosts file is located %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
Add an IP address like this 127.0.0.2<TAB>coolserver. Be sure to actually use the tab character, do not simply type <TAB>.
Replace 127.0.0.2 with the numeric IP address of your server.
Replace coolserver with any name you want; no spaces.
Additionally, the F1 key will toggle showing server addresses in the server list.
I do not know if this still works, but your free to try it!
