A hiking trail is a trail through a forest or other natural area. This page is a tutorial to help you build one.

You can build a hiking trail through almost any biome in the Overworld. In the Nether, it is recommended to build one in a Crimson Forest or Warped Forest biome. It is not ideal to build one in the End, as it is almost completely barren.
