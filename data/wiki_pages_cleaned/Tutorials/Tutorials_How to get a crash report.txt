This tutorial is to help you obtain crash reports generated by Minecraft. Crash reports can help developers confirm and diagnose issues and should be included in bugs on the Bug tracker whenever possible.

Navigate to your game directory as specified in your installation in the Launcher.
On Windows, it is %appdata%\.minecraft\ by default
On MacOS, it is ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft by default
On Linux, it is ~/.minecraft by default
Navigate into the crash-reports directory in the game directory.
If the crash reports directory does not exist, the game may have crashed of a JVM failure, and one or multiple hs_err_pid#####.log file may be present in the game directory instead. Upload this file.
There should be files named like crash-yyyy-mm-dd_hh.mm.ss-(client/server).txt. The crash reports are named by the time of crash, with which you can decide which file is your crash report.

Deobfuscating the crash report file with obfuscation maps and uploading the deobfuscated version to the Bug tracker may make it easier for Mojang developers to track down the cause of the crash.
Retrace is the tool to parse obfuscation maps. To run retrace, you need to have Java 8 or above installed on your device.
You can download proguard from their GitHub releases. Decompress the downloaded archive, such as proguard-7.0.1.zip, into a directory. Enter its bin directory. There will be proguardgui.bat and proguardgui.sh executable files available.

On Windows, run the proguardgui.bat file.
On Unix systems, run the proguardgui.sh file.
A Java application will launch.

On the left side of the User Interface, there is a section, "ReTrace". Enter that section.
Download the obfuscation map you need for "Mapping file". Paste the crash report. You can then obtain the deobfuscated crash report for sharing.
