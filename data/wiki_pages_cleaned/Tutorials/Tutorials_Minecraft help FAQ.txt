Before anyone can help players in the Minecraft Discord channel or Minecraft Forums, please make sure that the following has been performed so that we can eliminate these as possibilities.  The player would be surprised how many problems these simple suggestions fix.
Note that no community channel is able to help players with account issues. For those, see the help website.

Make sure the machine meets the specifications provided by Mojang here.
Make sure the player is running the latest version of Java 16. On GNU/Linux, OpenJDK works as well but is not supported by Mojang. Headless (GUI-less) versions obviously can not run the game.
If you are experiencing weird behavior and are using the most recent Java, try reinstalling Minecraft (see below)
Some graphical issues may be related to old or outdated graphical drivers, make sure these are up to date from the manufacturer website. Windows update/device manager don't always install the correct ones.
If you are playing on a laptop/notebook/tablet or any other mobile device, make sure to be in high-performance mode rather than energy saving mode.
Make sure that your OS, in general, is up to date.
Windows: Windows Update
macOS: Software Update
Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint): in a terminal: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
RedHat-based GNU/Linux distributions: yum update
Arch-based Linux systems: pacman -Syu
If the player still have issues after this point, and none of the basic answers below can solve the problem, then make sure the following have been done:

If the game is crashing, copy and paste the crash log into Ubuntu Paste and copy the link into the channel with a description of your problem.
Please be patient, the people the help in this channel are volunteering their expertise. Also, all help in the channel is considered "best effort"

One of the common ways to fix an ailing Minecraft installation of various bugs is to simply re-install it.  Removing the launcher itself (the file you downloaded) however will not remove Minecraft.  The steps below should work for most people.
Important step: Be sure to do a forced update if you still have issues.

Navigate to your Application Data Folder: %AppData%
Double Click the .minecraft folder
Copy out the saves folder to a different location
Go back one directory (to where you can see .minecraft)
Delete the .minecraft folder (this may take a while)
Start the Minecraft.exe file to re-download Minecraft
Close Minecraft when you reach the title screen
Copy the saves folder back into the new .minecraft folder.  You can safely overwrite any data that's currently in this folder

Open a terminal
Copy and Paste the following, one at a time, into the terminal to delete the current minecraft installation and retain the current saved worlds.
(Do not remove files to the /tmp directory, things can get randomly cleared. It is generally bad practice to do so)
$ mv -v ~/.minecraft/saves ~/saves.old/

Be careful, do not continue if your terminal gives you an error. The next command deletes your minecraft folder so if the prior command did not work all your hard work would be lost! Do NOT Run this under sudo or the root user

$ rm -rf ~/.minecraft/*
$ mv ~/saves.old/saves ~/.minecraft/saves
$ rm -rf ~/saves.old

Start Minecraft like you normally would. Your saves should be intact and the Minecraft client will re-download itself for you.
Alternatively, open up your Home folder and press Ctrl+H. This shows all hidden files and folders. Navigate down to .minecraft. From here, you can work in essentially the same way as outlined in the instructions for Windows above.

Open a Finder window
Click the Go Menu item and Click Go to Folder
Type ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft into the text field and click Go
Drag the saves folder to your desktop
Drag everything else in the minecraft folder to the trash
Drag the saves folder back into the minecraft folder
Close the Finder window and launch the Minecraft App just like you would normally.

If you are having issues after a reinstall, or are having other client issues, you can try using forced update.

Open the Minecraft launcher
Click on the arrow (directly beside the version)
Click on "Latest Version!"
Click on "Play"
Soon, the client will re-download the game files

If Minecraft is not working due to an issue with Java, your Java install may be corrupt and/or out of date. To remedy a corrupt install, begin by uninstalling Java. After the uninstall is complete, you can then try reinstalling.
For Windows users, it is sometimes (rarely) necessary to use an uninstaller program, such as Revo Uninstaller (free) to remove Java. Revo will search in-depth for all things Java, and remove the files.
To re-download/update Java, visit Java's download page here. Download the correct version (of Java 8) for your machine, based on what operating system you have.
Make sure you be careful with all instructions! (Anyone can edit this page)

If Minecraft has poor performance, has graphics that are distorted, or is simply not working, it's possible that you need a driver or an updated driver installed.
Some graphics cards only accept drivers from the manufacturer of the computer (i.e. Dell, HP, Toshiba). Visit the support site of the company that affects you, if that ends up being the case for you.
Windows Update is not a good method for updating video drivers. If a generic driver is installed, you should remove it before installing a new driver. Create a system restore point, or perform a driver rollback if you experience issues after installing a new driver.
If further help is need the video in the link may help you to fix this error - 

AMD users: Use the AMD Driver Autodetect utility to automatically find your driver. Alternatively, use AMD's  GPU support webpage to find the appropriate driver.
Intel users: Use the  Intel Driver Update Utility  to automatically find your driver. Alternatively, use Intel's Download Center to find the appropriate driver.
Nvidia users: Use Nvidia's Smart Scan utility (Java required) to automatically find your driver. Alternatively, use Nvidia's Download drivers webpage to find the appropriate driver.

While in Minecraft, select the world you wish to backup and click edit. You will then have the option to create a backup, which will be saved in /.minecraft/backups as a .zip file.

Go here for information on setting up a server.

Download this script and run the following commands in a terminal:

sudo chmod 755 ~/Downloads/minecraft_installer.sh
sudo sh ~/Downloads/minecraft_installer.sh --install_client

Install proxychains and use a configuration file such as:

$ cat ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf
strict_chain
[ProxyList]
http <proxyHost> <proxyPort>

Then run Minecraft through proxychains:

$ proxychains java -jar Minecraft.jar

All of your single-player worlds are stored in the saves folder within your installation folder. There is a subfolder for each world.

The following steps will link your .minecraft/saves folder with a Dropbox account. The way in which you do this depends on your OS. Please note that dropbox provides 2GB of free storage, after which you will have to pay a monthly subscription fee to expand your storage. Google Drive gives you 15GB of free storage.
The following steps assume that you have set Dropbox up to use the default folder and that you have not changed the .minecraft folder. Make sure that Minecraft and the Minecraft Launcher are closed before proceeding.

Open a terminal window.
Paste the following into your terminal:
mv ~/.minecraft/saves ~/Dropbox/Minecraft; ln -s $HOME/Dropbox/Minecraft $HOME/.minecraft/saves

Close the terminal

This takes advantage of some of the UNIX underpinnings of the OS. 

Open a terminal window.
Paste the following into your terminal:
mv ~/Library/"Application Support"/minecraft/saves ~/Dropbox/Minecraft;ln -s $HOME/Dropbox/Minecraft $HOME/Library/"Application Support"/minecraft/saves

Close the terminal.

This uses symbolic links so you will need to get under the hood a little bit.

Open File Explorer, and navigate to %AppData%\.minecraft
Open a second File Explorer window with the My Dropbox folder open
Move the saves folder in the .minecraft window to the My Dropbox window
Rename the saves folder to Minecraft
Close both Fie Explorer windows
Go to Start  Run and type CMD and hit enter. (You may need to run the command prompt as an administrator.)
Type the following: (Be sure to double-check the path to your Dropbox folder.)
mklink /d %AppData%\.minecraft\saves %HomePath%\Documents\Dropbox\Minecraft

Close the Command Prompt window.

This uses symbolic links so you will need to get under the hood a little bit.

Download Junction from Microsoft's site and install it.
Open a new File Explorer window
Go to %AppData%\.minecraft
Open a second File Explorer window with the Dropbox folder open
Move the saves Folder in the .minecraft window to the Dropbox window
Rename the saves Folder to Minecraft
Close both windows
Open the Start Menu, type cmd and hit enter.
Type the following:
junction -d %AppData%\.minecraft\saves "%HomePath%\My Documents\Dropbox\Minecraft"

Close the Command Prompt window.

If you want to simply manually back them up for later use, you can either copy out the whole saves folder or just the world folder that you want to backup.  If you want to move the order to the worlds in the saved menu, just change the number at the end of the world folder name to adjust the order as you would like.
