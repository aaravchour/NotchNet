Update suppression is the practice of forcing the game to skip block updates. Update suppression has potential applications for portal slicing, block duplication, controlled crashing, and placing blocks in otherwise impossible locations, such as a sign or torch floating in mid-air, or a flower on non-dirt-based blocks.
With the changing of update order in Java Edition 22w11a, stack overflow update suppression was "fixed". This was intended as MC-249082 was resolved as "Works As Intended". Nevertheless, the change was reverted in 22w12a and a separate but related bug report, MC-249181, showed that the "bug" was fixed in this snapshot.
