Commands are useful for map building, Creative mode, etc. The ones described on this page are useful for building an adventure map, testing mechanics and commands, or just for pure fun.

Item Frame is an entity . We can get an invisible Item Frame using /give command. This is the command: /give @p minecraft:item_frame{EntityTag:{Invisible:1}}

Note: If you are too lazy to write these long commands, you can always use commands generators in the internet.

Villagers are passive mobs and they live in villages. We can trade with them. By using a /summon command, we can spawn villagers with custom trades. /summon villager ~ ~1 ~ {VillagerData:{profession:farmer,level:2,type:plains},CustomName:"\"John\"",Offers:{Recipes:[{buy:{id:emerald,Count:1},sell:{id:wheat,Count:1},rewardExp:0b,maxUses:9999999}]}}
This command will spawn a villager named John who sells 1 wheat for 1 emerald.

You can edit the profession:farmer to other professions, type:plains to specific biomes. You can see all the professions and types at here.

Change the id to any items or blocks. Count defines the number of items.

rewardExp is the experience you get when you traded. maxUses is how many times you can trade with.

By using /fill command, you can replace a type of block in an area. 

/fill 16 ~ 16 0 ~ 0 minecraft:stone replace minecraft:grass_block

By using /give command, we can get a netherite sword with a custom level of sharpness.

/give @p minecraft:netherite_sword{Enchantments:[{id:sharpness,lvl:10}]} 1
The command above will give you a netherite sword with Sharpness 10. You will see the enchantment as Sharpness X. You can change the id to any enchantment.

Change lvl to any number. The maximum number is 255, if your number is bigger than 255, The level will automatically change to 255.

To get more than one enchantment on a tool or weapon, add a comma after the first enchantment and add a new one.
