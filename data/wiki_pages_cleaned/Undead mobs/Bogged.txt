A bogged is a variant of a skeleton found in swamp biomes. It is an undead hostile mob that can shoot arrows of Poison.

Bogged naturally spawn within the swamp biome, similar to how strays spawn in snowy biomes. Bogged may also be spawned from ranged mob trial spawners in trial chambers.

Upon death, bogged may drop:

Bones
Arrows
Arrows of Poison
Damaged bows.

Bogged behave very similarly to skeletons. They will attack nearby players by shooting arrows tipped with poison at them. Notably, bogged are much slower to reload their bows than normal skeletons, taking 3.5 seconds rather than 2.0, and also have 4 less health.

The Bogged was released for Valentine's Day 2024.
The name "Bogged" is likely a reference to the idiom "bogged down", meaning to be stuck or slowed by something difficult, either physically or mentally, as if stuck in a bog (a type of wetland similar to a swamp, but with grass and shrubs and almost no trees growing in waterlogged peat).
The name and theme of the mob are likely a reference to Bog Bodies, mummified human cadavers found in peat bogs.
