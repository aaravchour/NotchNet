A zombie horse is an unused variant of the regular horse. Zombie horses appear to be the horse equivalent of zombies. Like zombies, zombie horses are green-skinned and their eyes are completely black.

Zombie horses may be created by the /summon command or with their spawn egg. When using a spawn egg, 20% spawn as foals. In the upcoming game drop called "Mounts of Mayhem", zombie horses will be able to spawn naturally in plains, usually ridden by zombie horsemens. They do not spawn in peaceful mode, despite being passive.

Upon death, zombie horses drop:

0-2 Rotten Flesh. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.
13 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.
If saddled, they drop their saddle.
Zombie foals yield neither items nor experience.

                                                                           
Tamed and saddled zombie horses can be used as one of the fastest means of transportation in the game. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences.
In Bedrock Edition, they cannot be ridden.

Zombie horses have a lone equipment slot.

 Saddle slot: For equipping a saddle.
In Bedrock Edition, they have no slot.

Once a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with directional controls, jump, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the dismount control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a horse.
A ridden horse automatically runs up any one-block-high slope. The horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.
Ridden saddled zombie horses have the ability of "jumping charging". When the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled zombie horses can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Zombie horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.

The zombie horse is an undead mob that is completely passive. Zombie horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Zombie horses can breathe in water.
Unlike other passive mobs, zombie horses slowly regenerate health. In Bedrock Edition, zombie horses will be killed by the Conduit like any regular hostile mob, despite being passive.
In Mounts of Mayhem, zombie horses also burn during the daylight, despite being passive. However, horse armor can provide protection from the sunlight.
Zombie horses, in common with other undead mobs, take damage when affected by a Potion of Healing and are healed by a Potion of Harming. They are also affected by the Smite enchantment.

Zombie horses cannot be tamed. However, a tamed zombie horse can be summoned using /summon minecraft:zombie_horse ~ ~ ~ {Tame:1b}. In Mounts of Mayhem, they can be tamed and ridden like many horse variants.
In Bedrock Edition, technically, all zombie horses are always regarded as tamed.

Zombie horses share a similar green color, with black eyes, mane, snout and hoofs. They sometimes have bones sticking out from underneath their flesh.
In Mounts of Mayhem, zombie horses appear in a desaturated, mouldy-green color; however, they still share their previous distinctions. They also sometimes have bones visibly sticking out from underneath their flesh.

Zombie horses are spawned with constant health of 15, speed of 0.2, and have a jump strength ranging from 0.41.0, tending toward the average 0.7.

Java Edition:
Zombie horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.

Bedrock Edition:

Zombie horses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.

Zombie Horses are an unsupported mob and as such issues relating to them may not be fixed.

Dr. Zhark appears in the credits after the End Poem as the creator of horses, including zombie horses.
If a player pulling a zombie horse with a lead enters a boat, the zombie horse follows by swimming at the same speed as the boat.
A player riding a zombie horse is dragged along if the zombie horse is being pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted up in the air in the same way.
The texture for zombie horses contains an unused saddlebag that has a different appearance from those of donkeys or mules.
