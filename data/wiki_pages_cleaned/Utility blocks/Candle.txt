Not to be confused with Torch.

A candle is a dyeable block that emits light when lit with a flint and steel. Up to four of the same color of candle can be placed in one block space, which affects the amount of light produced.

Non-dyed candles and white candles can be found in ancient cities. Brown, green, purple, and red candles can be found in trail ruins.

Candles drop themselves as items when mined using any tool, or without a tool.

Candles can be used as a light source, emitting light like a sea pickle. A single candle emits a light level of 3. Up to four identically colored candles may be placed in one block, with each candle increasing the emitted light level by 3, for a maximum light level of 12. They also emit fire particles. 
Candles are not lit when they are placed, and must be lit using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile. In Bedrock Edition, a mob/player that is burning, a Fire Aspect book or any sword enchanted with Fire Aspect can also be used to light candles. Candles may be waterlogged, but waterlogged candles cannot be lit. Lit candles can be extinguished using water (including using a water bottle) or by the player interacting with the candle.

A single candle of any color may be used on an uneaten cake, turning it into a candle cake, which acts as a normal single candle. Only one candle can be placed on a cake. If the candle cake is eaten or destroyed, the candle is dropped.

A single candle has the same width as iron bar or glass pane.
