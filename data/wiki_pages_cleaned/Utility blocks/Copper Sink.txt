The copper sink is a joke block introduced in Java Edition 23w13a_or_b. It can be used to hold water.
Copper sinks can only be crafted and placed if the "Add Copper Sink" proposal is approved.

Copper sinks do not have an associated tool and cannot be dropped with Silk Touch.

Copper sinks can be filled with water. They are implemented rather simply: a water bucket can be emptied in a sink after which it becomes filled, interacting with a filled sink using an empty bucket fills the bucket. Bottles cannot interact with the copper sink, nor can buckets with other liquids.
Dropping any exclusively copper-based items into the sink will delete them, including Raw Copper, Copper Ingot, Block of Copper, and other copper sinks.

Copper sink blocks are an unsupported item due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed.

The copper sink block is a joke referring to the Minecraft community's request that Mojang add a copper "sink" (in videogame development language, a "sink" metaphorically refers to a gameplay feature that requires constant resource investment, preventing the situation in which players begin hoarding resources as they have more than they could ever need), as copper ingots have few uses compared to other similar items like iron ingots. This would explain why the recipe makes use of blocks of copper rather than copper ingots.
