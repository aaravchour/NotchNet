A note block is a block that emits sounds when attacked, used or powered with redstone. The sound produced can be altered in various ways by using it or putting certain blocks directly above or below it. A note block's sound played repeatedly can be used to direct allays to stay nearby and drop collected items near it.

Note blocks generate in ancient cities.

Note blocks are most quickly broken with an axe.

Note blocks play a musical note when hit (pressing the attack button) or powered by redstone. A note block must have air in the space directly above it to play a sound. Notes can be heard up to 48 blocks away. The volume of a note block decreases as the player gets further away from it. The volume of note blocks (as well as jukeboxes) can be independently controlled by the Jukebox/Note Blocks slider in the audio settings.
Note blocks play when on or next to a powered block. Each time a note block plays a note, a note particle may fly out of the top (if pressed too fast, notes may not appear), with the color depending on the pitch (but not the instrument).
There are 16 different instruments and 25 different pitches per instrument. Pressing the use button on the block increases the note pitch up a semitone, with a total of two full octaves and a semitone (25 semitones in total) being available for each instrument. The standard range (for harp and pling instruments) of notes span from F3 to F5. After reaching the highest note, pressing use again resets the pitch back to F3, as does breaking the block and picking it back up.
The string bass and didgeridoo are two octaves (24 semitones) lower than the standard range, the guitar is one octave (12 semitones) lower than the standard range, the flute is one octave above the standard range, and the bells, chimes, and xylophone are 2 octaves above the standard range. This gives the player six octaves (72 semitones) of effective range to combine instruments for greater pitch coverage.
The exact pitch can be found from its use-count by using the following formula: 2 ^ ((use count - 12) / 12).
The exact pitch to use-count assignment is shown below, along with the note's color, which is rendered with shading using the particle's texture.

Alternatively, there is a graphical version available:

Players can roughly check the tuning of a block by looking at the note icon.

In Java Edition, the tuning can also be checked by looking at the right side of the debug screen (accessed by pressing F3). It is denoted as "note:" followed by a number from 0 to 24.

The instrument played depends on the material of the block underneath the note block. Note that these are groups of blocks defined by the code, not just the individual block.

When a mob head is placed on top of a note block, the sound made by the note block will instead be that of the corresponding mob's ambient sound, with the exception of the creeper head, which instead causes the note block to play the primed sound.

Note blocks can be powered in a variety of different ways following normal redstone principles; however, some ways of powering note blocks are more convenient than others or produce unexpected results. 

When a note block is powered by a button on its side, it does play a note, but is often difficult to hear because the sound of the button can overlap the note block.
Because note blocks need space above them, note blocks powered by pressure plates or redstone directly above them do not make a sound.

If an allay hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location, it tries to path find to the note block and then spends 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player. After 30 seconds, the allay returns to targeting its player. A vibration particle emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing wool between the note block and the allay can prevent this interaction. 

Note blocks can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

In Bedrock Edition, a note block has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.
See Bedrock Edition level format/Block entity format.

Issues relating to "Note block" or "Noteblock" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.

Because a note block is a wooden type block, a note block directly on top of another one produces a string bass sound when powered.
In Java Edition, note blocks have the second highest number of possible block state combinations, at 1150, beating fire's 512 and behind redstone dust's 1296.
In Creative mode, the only way to hit a note block to play it without breaking it or changing its pitch is by doing so while holding a sword.
