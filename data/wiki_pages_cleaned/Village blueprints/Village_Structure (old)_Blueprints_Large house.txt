A common house made up of cobblestone, oak logs, oak planks, an oak door, glass panes, and oak stairs. This can be mirrored and the oak can be swapped out with spruce or acacia if it is the taiga or savanna variant, respectively.

Note: the oak wood stairs are optional for the first layer and generates only if the house was spawned above street level. 
Another Note: If the house was spawned level with the street, this floor has the cobblestone and planks in the ground instead of above the ground.
