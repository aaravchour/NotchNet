A small hut made of logs, wooden planks, glass panes, dirt and cobblestone, with an optional fence post & pressure plate table. (The wooden pressure plate is replaced with brown carpet in Bedrock Edition.)
This generally tends to spawn next to wheat farms and on the outskirts of villages, and sometimes can generate with a table that can appear on the left or right back corners from the door. It always has dirt floors. This also has the "bump" on top.  The dirt floor can have tall grass on it, sometimes completely infesting the inside of the house.

Note: On some houses, the layer 5 alt replaces layer 5 and layer 6 is omitted.
